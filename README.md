# Hybris
[Hybris](https://www.hybrisforum.com/) was a website where people uploaded articles discussing the complex relationship between humans and technology (among other things). One of my friends submitted an article and reached out to me, encouraging me to submit an article as well. The articles on the website are eloquent and deeply insightful, skills which I do not usually associate with my writing. 

At the time, the state of the art in text generation was GPT-2. I bashed my head against the wall for 2 weeks trying to get a cohererent output, but it wasn't great. I included it in this repo if you're interested in reading it. 

I was unsatisfied with the output from GPT-2, so I shelved the project and moved on to other stuff. GPT-3 came out a few months later, and I was fortunate enough to get access to it. Between GPT-3 and Copilot, it's honestly a little scary how good the AI is at generating realistic text.

The way I generated this essay was by asking GPT-3 questions and splicing the result paragraphs together. I tried to change sentences as minimally as possible. For the most part, I only added transitions and changed tenses of responses. I did take a little poetic license on the final paragraph (can you blame me?). 

I've included 3 documents. [initial.pdf](https://github.com/harris-mohamed/hybris/blob/main/pdf/initial.pdf) is the full list of questions I asked GPT-3 and the answers I got. [prune.pdf](https://github.com/harris-mohamed/hybris/blob/main/pdf/prune.pdf) are the paragraphs I used from initial.pdf, rearranged to match the order they show up in the final essay but otherwise unaltered. [final.pdf](https://github.com/harris-mohamed/hybris/blob/main/pdf/final.pdf) is the final product, with all changes added. Looking at prune.pdf and final.pdf side by side should show you how much I changed to get to the final output. 

I was super impressed. Were you fooled? 

Don't worry, though. I wrote this README myself. (Or did I?)
