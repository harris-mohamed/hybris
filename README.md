# Hybris
[Hybris](https://www.hybrisforum.com/) is a website where people upload articles discussing the complex relationship between humans and technology (among other things). One of my friends submitted an article and reached out to me, encouraging me to submit an article as well. The articles on the website are eloquent and deeply insightful, skills which I do not usually associate with my writing. 

I have had a huge interest in GPT-3 for a while now, and figured this would the perfect project to try it on. My initial idea was to write down an essay on Artificial Intelligence and have GPT-3 write its own essay, hopefully reflecting my thoughts on the matter. Unfortunately, GPT-3 was deemed unsafe to make public, as its text samples were extremely realistic. I was forced to use a skinned down version of GPT-2. To say this was a downgrade is a huge understatement. My initial attempts had a lot of overfitting (it would spit back the same essay I wrote). I finally got it working (kinda) and writing creatively based on what thoughts I put in. The code is detailed in this colaboratory notebook. I feel like I've genuinely hit the limits of GPT-2. A lot of other projects I see either don't care too much about coherency or have a lot more sample data to train with. Until the day that GPT-3 comes out, this is as good as this project will be.
