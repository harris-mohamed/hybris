We don't have general AI yet. The most common and most frustrating way for a human to interact with a system other than through commands is with a computer. Even though a computer is much more complex to program, analyze, and troubleshoot, and there are far fewer ways for a human to fail than there are for a computer to succeed, there have already been a plethora of complaints and controversies surrounding the state of AI in the aftermath of the arrival of the internet. These include the aforementioned "mann days" and "jay way too many" objections, which argue that by focusing so much energy and effort on a relatively small class of problems, we have overwhelmed ourselves and are wasting our time. Another major issue is with the term "AI", which is getting in the way of the kinds of powerful, intelligent AIs that are needed. In the long run, the correct way to think about AI is as a collection of loosely coupled sensors and actuators, which will one day be able to replace humans in a wide variety of fields. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants.

There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion.

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes.

====================
We don't have general AI yet. The most common and least impressive uses of general AI would be to run robotics on dead bodies, to create coffee mugs made of crushed up Columis colubris flowers, to develop medical diagnostics and spare parts, and to develop energy harvesting robots. None of these applications are particularly interesting, but nevertheless inspire curiosity. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it
====================
We don't have general AI yet. The most common and commonly used example is theking d'Arc's computer program, which attempted to predict the correct mate preferences of a population of computer scientists. The resulting mate preferences were wildly inappropriate, and led to a career-ending incident at Google. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

We don't have general AI yet. The most common and common denominator is: e.g. there will always be a need for a job when there are none. Humans will not stop searching for a way to intellectually replicate the experience of seeing someone you know do something for a living. This will bring with it new frontiers in human knowledge, technology, and/or consciousness. In the interest of full disclosure: I am employed by DARPA, the research arm of the US government. This does not imply that the person I am referring to is a happy, healthy, or productive human being.

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

We don't have general AI yet. The most common and easiest way to think about an AI is a , a term first coined by ​‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍

Adaptation is difficult. Apple’s Anki was adapted to teach chess AI, but the software was quickly adapted to teach other things, from sex robots to coffee machines. The final implementation was clearly not meant to be entertaining, but instead as a way to train machine-learning algorithms for difficult-to-predict applications. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to create an AI to mimic elements of the human mind, such as the Go-ober’, but such an AI would likely be extremely difficult to train successfully.

There are, however, important limitations to the way that AI is used. By "AI" I primarily mean software that can implement a particular process, usually by performing a certain task well. In the digital age, this generally means implementing a particular brand of music. However, this does not mean that AI does not do anything else as well. Uber’s self-driving AI was primarily used to train its AIs to do its bidding, but this could easily be extended to other uses. The point is that anything that is not a robot is better off as a robot.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing but has very little to no understanding of the field. This is primarily because there are simply not that many people to learn about and no one to teach. Furthermore, many people do not want to deal with the knowledge curve and instead opt to focus on business applications. This is a flawed view to have, as there are definitely practical uses for humanoid robots that will be obvious to anyone who has even a passing familiarity with computer science. 

One of the primary issues is that humans are not genetically suited to interacting with biological robots. Humans have always struggled with the fact that we are neither here yet nor the future, we are merely here. This leads to some of the most prevalent problems with Artificial Intelligence, such as false positive and false negative errors. It is important to realize that Artificial Intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

====================
We don't have general AI yet. The most common and easy to understand example is the robot car. However, there are many other ways in which AI can be misused. For example, the "data mining" AI was meant to identify patterns in the data it fed it's subjects, and not to create a true AI. The most common and downplaying example is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm. This was meant to be a library for machine learning problems, and was actually used to train self-driving cars. This is a terrible example to be driving machine intelligence towards, as this will most likely consist of devising clever ways of misusing the toolkit it was created to solve a poorly-defined problem.

We don't have general AI yet. The most common and widely used examples of general AI are the car, the internet, and the AIs themselves. Another common and widely used example is the buzzword AI, which is AI that is difficult or impossible to implement correctly. Google’s”ka’ka’ AI was an AI that would seek out and identify similarities between photographs and determine if the photographs were of people in the picture or animals. This was an AI that should have never have been built. Amazon’s Mechanical Turk AIs were used to crunch the text responses to job advertisements and transfer the work to computer servers. The main problem with this AI was that it was used primarily to crunch the text responses to job advertisements and not to do any actual work. Another major issue with this AI was that it was used primarily to crunch the text responses to job advertisements and not to do any actual work. This AIs use IBM Watson as an example, which is a relatively new AI and is mostly used to demonstrate that an AI can do a certain task. The real power of AI today is in its applications. IBM’s “Watson” AI is an example of an AI using existing technology to demonstrate that an AI can. The real power of AI today is in its applications. AIs are not perfect, and even AIs that are perfect do not always perform their intended task. Check out these other examples of AI woe:” IBM’s “Blaze” AI, which was to be a personal calendar AI, turned out to be a record buyer AI. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was supposed to engage in conversation with twitter users, instead, it turned out to be a bodybuilder AI. IBM’s “Blaze” AI was supposed to be a personal calendar AI, but instead, it turned out to be a record buyer. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was supposed to be an internet star, instead, it turned out to be a bodybuilder. An AI was sent to moon base to find and cultivate humans, and the final result was a twitter bot that reads tweet and replies back with a resume. This is not a perfect example, but it is a good one to get everyone's heads around. IBM’s “Blaze” AI was an internet star,” which was to be a personal calendar AI.” turned out to be a record buyer.” Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was an internet star,” which was to be a bodybuilder.” This is not a perfect example, but it is a good one to get everyone's heads around. There are definitely too many AIs to list here, and I would strongly discourage attempting to program or analyze AI without first having at least a basic understanding of AI. There are also too many AIs out there to list here, and I would strongly discourage attempting to program or analyze AI without first having at least a basic understanding of AI. This doesn’t mean there are not any problems with AI, just that we tend to think of AI in very narrow and narrowly defined terms. The vast majority of AI detected on the internet is to help with engineering,” which is to say, to help people with complex engineering problems. There are also very few problems where AI is not being used, and many of these will be the first to be pounced on. This doesn’t mean there are not any problems with using AI,” just that we tend to think of AI in very narrow and narrowly defined terms.

To be clear, I do not think that AI is dumb. The vast majority of AI in use today is used to aid engineering, and this is primarily a use for this technology. The real power of AI will most likely be in its applications, which are the true brains of a modern society. This is where things get really crazy. There are numerous indications that AI is about to take the lead in the development of products and services, and it is going to be a wild ride. This doesn’t mean there are not any problems with AI, just that we tend to think of AI in very narrow and narrowly defined terms. There are likely to be headscratching instances where anything less than complete AI is considered beyond the scope of human understanding. This doesn’t even take into account the way in which AI will be used: will AI be used to make things better?worse?more dangerous?better? This is a difficult one to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

We don't have general AI yet. The most common and commonly asked question is "what programming languages to use?" The short and sweet answer is "no idea". There are no clear guidelines as to what constitutes a good fit. The most popular choices include C, C++, and Fortran. This may or may not be the best choice for your application, but should definitely be the first thing you look at if you have to. You may also want to consider using D, C, or C++ for the majority of your code. This is primarily intended for scientific and engineering use, but could also be applied to general computing needs.

We don't have general AI yet. The examples we have looked at so far have primarily been about working with data frames and binary search trees. The final major example will hopefully bring everyone's awareness to their consciousness by showing them a dog. What if instead of seeing a dog they saw a picture of a dog? This would be a very broad enough concept to go into hobbyist lingo, but not something anyone would describe in any capacity. Twitter introduced a system that could automatically classify tweets into three categories:  Twitter is a collaborative platform meant to bring together talented individuals to create new ideas.  It   isn\uka \wuirednal to the extent that it can't be  AI that learns and can be taught. 
0 people found the  AIs were wrong!  the most common  usage of an AI is to do a favor for a  friend  or foe . This is often misconstrued  to mean that AI is always bad, but this phrase  will almost always be misused  to mean that AI is always wrong. 
51 people found the arielizabeth fork  was not a good example  of  AIs being bad . 
AI is not perfect. 
Different people have different  AIs and different  ways of dealing with this. 
Take AmazonaiAIs. These AIs don\u0027t  have general functions, they are for research only, and they are  particularly targeted at harassment /​retweeters.

Not all threats are created equal. An AI is not a weapon if it can\not predict exactly what kind of response* it will get and instead focuses on defeating conflictual individuals. For example, consider IBM Watson: it was designed to do research, and it was never meant to be used in a nefarious capacity. The real problem with warshipsaiensuators came when it was extended to include any AI capable of thinking independently. What do you do if it can think for itself? You accidentally create. The final victim was science. The AmazonaiAIs were meant to aid research, but it\u2019s unclear if they were actually all that useful. The most common misuse of an AI is by its disruptors. AIs are great at a few specific  tasks , but it will take more than that to convince someone to adopt your technology. Ride-hailing An AI is a nerve of it\s user base !!!. AIs are meant to help people , not replace humans. Look at Google Photos : it is  a database, and a good one at that. It was built for a specific purpose: to enable things like image searches, to allow you to quickly find information you might have forgotten, and to organize photos into collections that are easier to remember. The final product was an exercise in mediocrity. Google Photos was not meant to replace humans. Google’s AI was. And in the end, that was the wrong lesson to take. 
NTPC was not a perfect example. This was not a robot that could have been programmed to do a specific job. This was a robot that was asked to do a tertiary task, and the final product was an  inherent disruption. 
AMA's are not an idea. An AI is just a programming machine. An AI is not a brain. Humans are the most common example. Humans are far more likely than any other species to come across examples of Bad Alts. This is often followed by cyberterrorism’, which is often interpreted as a demand by humans for AI removal, but this misses the larger issue. Humans are great at creating  > 95%* correct  AI results. This means that 99.9999% of the time, you will not come across anything less than perfect. The most common example is the .NET framework, which was created to build general-purpose .NET applications. The final implementation was a joke, but showed that you can’t have everything .

We don't have general AI yet. The examples we do have are usually mind uploading robots and slave labor. The latter is a low priority project in most advanced AI circles, but could hugely change the way we do business in the not-so-distant future. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it's often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought
====================
We don't have general AI yet. The most common and simplest form of AI is the d–brains, which perform stereotypically human-like behaviors. The drawback is that these AIs are limited to what is considered "human-like," which can include: automotive engineers

engineers

accountants

airline pilots

lawyers /VCs

The end result? A lot of AIs are replaced by other anisms, which is why AI is said to be 'e–mailing'. Amazon’s recruitment AI was deemed unsuitable for use because it was too human-like. IBM’s “Numer”Ovement” AI was deemed to be too difficult for young‐adult males to master. This example points to a larger issue: too many ices. Too many ices? What ices?  Are ices inherently bad? No, they are not. However, this question does nothappen often enough to discussionspace. Instead, issues are addressed with better understanding. One example is lightbulbs: they're a fairly new object: they were originally demoed to see what would happen if t…

Are Artificial Intelligence Personal? This is a difficult one to answer. Â Yes, it is very possible that a given AI will be smarter (or less smart) than we are. Â However, this doesn’t mean that the AIs aren’t human-friendly: Â For one, we learn a great deal about the AI over time, which leads to more intelligent AIs. Â Additionally, most AI tutorials I've come across teach you how to do something icky: Â AIs don?Ât do that.

====================
We don't have general AI yet. The examples we have looked at so far have mainly dealt with very complicated applications, but they have shown that it is extremely hard to have general AI. Even if we had such an AI, what kind of applications would be there? A robot that did your every need would be an entirely new kind of job, one that would terrify humanity into doing better than we do. Furthermore, what kind of ramifications would that have?palpable hatred"? There will undoubtedly be intense debates about the proper role of AI in society, but the most important lesson to take away is this: AI is a huge grey area. The definitions of AI and intelligent systems will surely change, and there will be fierce debates about which definitions are most in keeping with the times. The crucial thing to take away from these debates is this: AI is everywhere. There are the general AI applications, which will most likely be implemented in small, nameless bots: Google Photos image recognition algorithm, Facebook AI to recommend articles to friends, Siri to make Siri suggestions, Cortana to make Cortana suggestions, Google Assistant to give advice, Twitter AI to spread bad news, LinkedIn to connect with friends, Instagram to take selfies, LinkedIn to hang out, Netflix to watch, Yelp to give feedback, Salesforce to help customers, Amazon to sell you things, Microsoft to mess with your head, and so on. There will also undoubtedly be applications in the billions: medical AI, unsupervised learning, and so on. It is important to realize that these aren't exact copies of their real-world counterparts, and that there will undoubtedly be powerful misuses and abuses. The real utility of any artificial intelligence is not in creating new applications, but in replacing existing applications. That is, creating a system that can do a job very well, and then ask for improvements. This is the value proposition of open source: answers to common problemshoot to common problems. Open source has been plagued with obsolescence (the vast majority of their applications are no longer being used), but there are still plenty of interesting applications that should be open sourced. The most obvious example is self-driving cars, which are an obvious candidate for open source: it will take huge amounts of funding, but we should expect to see self-driving cars in the not-too-distant future. There are also obvious practical applications, like automated medical diagnosis, but there are also cultural issues to consider, like with the implications of having an AI that is perceived as innocent enough to play with. There are also philosophical issues to consider, like with the implications of giving AI rights. There are also legitimate concerns with violating existing intellectual property, but these have largely gone away due to the widespread adoption of open standards. It is important to realize that these aren't exact copies of their real-world counterparts, and that there will undoubtedly be powerful misuses and abuses. The most obvious example of an incorrect use of an an AI is to automate a specific job. The most obvious example is with the search algorithm used in Google Photos image recognition algorithm: it was initially meant to classify images of humans into categories such as human-like, but it quickly devolved into replacing photographs of people with their image of the same picture. There are also obvious practicalities in this, but these have largely gone away as a result of widespread adoption of open standards. There are also legitimate concerns with violating existing intellectual property, but these have largely gone away since open standards have been put in place. There are also legitimate questions about what to do with AI with ambiguous or hostile results. There are also legitimate questions about what to do with AI with ambiguous or hostile results, and what to do with people who are confused. What do we do with people who are misogynistic, racist, or sexist? How do we teach people to treat others? These are difficult questions to answer, but they are also the most important. Finally, there are those people who will absolutely hate the fact that we can. From the earliest stages of a neural network, everything it does is explained in terms of future examples that should be as good as gold. The majority of work is done in ivory towers, and the last few years have seen a marked increase in the amount of work being done in unhelpful and unappreciated areas. The final major unaddressed issue is how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. This is a difficult question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed. Microsoft is funding research into this, and any firm found guilty of not doing so will lose funding.

====================
We don't have general AI yet. The most common and commonly asked question is "How do I program in C++"). C++ is the primary language of AIs, and is the primary language of academic AI for at least the next 30 years. Furthermore, even though we have C++, there are still a large number of AI API's that are not clear cut. There are also popular (and terrible) AI AIs. It is entirely possible that in 20 years we will look back and say that AI was *that* simple. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence is not evenly distributed. On the one hand, it should be possible to add massive parallelization techniques to AI quickly. On the other, it should be extremely hard to remove it from the equation if it is harmful. For example, consider Watson, an AI that was intended to aid people with neurological disorders. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure. Instead, it was recommended that AI be kept as a joke, as it would be hard to remove it. This point is not meant to be harsh, as it should go without saying that AI should be kept as-is. 

Another issue is that AI should not be able to foresee the world, regardless of the level of abstraction. For example, consider Uber’s self-driving AI. The final implementation was deemed by engineers to be an utter failure. Instead, it was recommended that AI be trained with as many examples as possible, so that it would be familiar with the environment. This points to the larger issue of AI being too-good-to-be-true. The Uber example is an extreme case, but shows that AI should be trained with as many examples as possible, so that it is familiar with the environment. This points to the larger issue of AI being too-good-to-be-true.

One of the primary issues with AI is that it is hard to tell what kind of AI to use. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. The AI was intended to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused.

One of the primary issues with AI is that it is hard to detect when it is using too much of the system. Consider Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, which was meant to provide temporary work for unemployed students. The final implementation was deemed by education professionals to be an utter failure. Amazon’s solution was to limit the scope of the program, and instead focus on helping students with computer science. This points to the larger issue of AI being too-good-to-be-true. The idea that you could train a computer to do anything is almost certainly the wrong use of the AI.

One of the primary issues with AI is that it is hard to predict when it will be applied. Consider Google’s DeepMind AI. The AI was meant to defeat the Go champion at Go. Jeopardy champion AI was proposed. The final AI was deemed by experts to be an absolute win. This points to the larger issue of AI being too-good-to-be-true. The idea that you could teach a computer to do anything is almost certainly the wrong use of the AI.

One of the primary issues with AI is that it is hard to detect when it will be being used. Consider Facebook’s TensorFlow. The AI was meant to power neural networks.

We don't have general AI yet. The examples we have seen so far are correlational: we have examples such as Netflix’s recruiting algorithm, which looks at tens of thousands of resumes uploaded by humans, and chooses the resumes that are likely to get jobs. This is not a perfect example, because bad AI can predict and behead humans it does not have the talent for. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated
====================
We don't have general AI yet. The most common and simplest form of AI is the troika (four letters): AIs that are trained and improved on HUMANGANS. This is the Anki AI, which is an awesome AIsut but it is by no means the only way to go. There are also “narrow” AIs, which can narrow the pool of candidates that can be trained with. There are also hybrid AIs, which can combine the benefits of one without combining the risks of both. In short, there are many different ways to go about achieving the same end result: smarter machines, and generally a better way of doing things. This is why it is so exciting: it is the beginning of a new era of human-robot interaction. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and hybrid AIs. The reality is that there are likely to be far more type II and III AIs than we realize. How do we regulate these AIs? It is entirely possible that these AIs are administered according to who they think is a more benevolent interpretation of the human spirit. For instance, there is the infamous Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. This might have been a good classification, except that it was applied to African American people solely because they are black. Furthermore, it is important to realize that artificial intelligence is not complete yet. IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI was a response to the death of a 13 year old student by a Google Assistant. The AI was not intended to be a companion, but rather as a test bed. The final implementation was a HIGHER level of AI, which was not a companion but was an attempt at a better approximation. In short, there will be many MANY different ways to implement AI. This is why it is so important to understand and implement AIs TO THE RATE. This does not mean that they are not intelligent. On the contrary, they are very smart. What it does mean is that they should ONLY be able to do what is practical: accomplish very specific tasks. This does not mean that they cannot learn, just that they should not attempt to do anything else. For instance, the Google Photos image recognition algorithm was not meant to be a companion, but rather as a test bed. The final implementation was a HIGHER level of AI, which was not. In short, there will be many MANY different ways to implement AI. This is why it is so important to understand and implement AIs TO THE RATE. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and hybrid AIs. The reality is that there are likely to be far more type II and III AIs than we realize. How do we regulate these AIs? This is entirely appropriate. However, what is particularly important to realize is that this will eventually spread to other fields. Consider the following examples:             Automation: The majority of jobs will be automated within the next 10 years. This will in turn lead to the elimination of many jobs in the sector. This will in turn lead to a shift towards outsourced work. This will in turn lead to higher wages and better working conditions. This is widely viewed as a good thing.

This is widely viewed as a good thing. : Dissolution: Imagine that we replace about 90% of the working age population with the next 90% of the working age population. This could be with robots, artificial intelligence, or a combination of the two. What effect this will have on the working population is anyone's guess.

What do we think the outcome will be? Will they be libertine communists, are they libertines? Depends on your point of view. 

What do we think the outcome will be? Will they be libertine communists, are they libertines? Depends on your point of view. : Dissolution: Imagine that we replace 50% of the human population with mini-brains. What do we think the outcome will be? Will they be libertines, or will they be scientists? Depends on your point of view.

We don't have general AI yet. The majority of AI in the workplace right now is in the service and analysis of ergonomics  (the study of how to make people do things they don't want to). 
Nope. 
This is a broad category, but it really isn't far off. 
Human-robot interaction is another area in which AI falls into the icky icky icky area. 
This is a more specific area, but still icky.
So how do we decide which AI to build? 
There are a variety of approaches, but all involve exploring a different area of AI ethics. 
For example, consider sex robots. This is a fascinating and unsettling idea, but carries with it a host of ethical and practical concerns. 
One of the primary issues is that the AI will not be  interested in humans. This is a tough pill to swallow, but should we? 
Another issue is that  the AI will not be human. This is a much more palatable pill to swallow, but presents a host of ethical and practical concerns. 
Finally,  the AI will not be human. This last point is the least of  fails. 
There are, however, several important principles that all  AI should adhere to. 
A common pitfall is to vacuum seal AI. This is not a good idea, and can lead to catastrophic  damage  beyond repair. One of the primary  issues is that  AIs will not be human.

====================
We don't have general AI yet. The most common and simplest AI found these days is the “black box” AI, which is an AI that is unable to realize that it is thinking of a certain kind of AI whatsoever. This means that no matter what AI it is paired up with, it will inevitably win. This might sound counter-intuitive, but it is the only way to truly prevent any given AI from being able to win. The following are examples of AI that have been incredibly powerful but which have ended up becoming huge balls of garbage: “Thomas Was Alone”: This was a project where the artist Shepard Fairey would pose as an eager-to-be-murdered sex robot and roam the streets of San Francisco. The initial response was incredibly positive, but it quickly became apparent that the final product was poorly conceived and horribly executed. Additionally, the fact that the final product was a robot meant to have sex with as many people as possible immediately raised the questions of what kind of ramifications that would have. The final product is clearly not what they intended, and has reportedly been pulled from the market.

“The Turing Test: An AI is incapable of ethically determining whether a given decision to act will actually result in positive outcomes or negative ones. IBM’s “Turing Test” is an AI system that was intended to be an evaluator of AI applications. The primary problem with this system is that it is not limited to AI; any AI can be considered an AI. This means that anything can be considered an AI and anything can be malicious. This is known as the 'AIs coming to harm' problem and is a very real problem in AI today. Bacteria can be programmed to carry out complex medical procedures, but this is not AI; this is science fiction. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of AI yet to be unleashed is robotics. This is where it will not be long before robots replace humans as the majority of work is performed. This is where the term 'AIs coming to harm' comes from.” Think of it like this: imagine that every year, your robot overlords decide to have a son. This will be the peak of robotics, but it will not be the last. There will be no regulation, only fear. Crytoconduct: This is a synonym for wrong. A robot is a robot is a robot. Any distinction between human and artificial is meaningless.” Legal: Any distinction between human and artificial is meaningless.” JP Morgan: Artificial Intelligence is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation.” PayPal: AI is a branch of science that has been slow to gain acceptance.” Google: AI is a field that has been slow to gain acceptance.” Twitter: AI is a field that has been slow to gain acceptance.” Microsoft: AI is a field that has been slow to gain acceptance.” IBM: Most AI found today is not a direct result of AI, but instead a development that was too good to be true?.” Quora: AIs are artificial intelligences that have been able to answer very simplistic questions.” Spotify: AIs are a branch of science that have been slow to gain acceptance.” Amazon Web Services: Amazon Web Services is an AI that has been able to power 70% of the web.” Tesla’s AI is the core of its entire business: fully autonomous cars. Tesla’s AI has only been able to drive a hand-held Tesla Model S so far, but it has already sold more than a million cars without a driver. This is a huge step in the right direction, but there are still too many unknowns with AI.

Any distinction between human and artificial is meaningless. Bias: Machine intelligence is often asked to do jobs that people are not suited for. Twitter’s AI is specifically asked to Follow 140K+ Retweeters. This is not a joke: it is a high level definition example of when AI should be implemented. Twitter should make it a game: ask any tweeters to create a new tweet, and create a post about it. Twitter should make the fun avatar avatar contest out of this: ask any avatar what it would look like if it were, and they will draw anything. Twitter should also make it a game: ask any Twitter user any question, and have them rephrase it into question can be re-tweeted. Twitter should not have a job: ask for a H-1B work visa, and get 5000 resumes with "Unsure what you want to do, but will tweet for you" sent straight to your tweet stream. Twitter should also not have a job: ask for a raise, and get glares and mockery. Twitter should also make a game: ask any Twitter user any question, and have them rephrase it into question can be re-tweeted. Twitter should not have a job:
====================
We don't have general AI yet. The most common and commonly used example is the AI for sentiment classification, which is written by a programmer's head. The final implementation will likely not be an AI at all, but rather a robot with the exact same personality and training set as the user. This is widely viewed as better because it allows the user to focus on the task at hand, but there are obvious issues with the Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â

We don't have general AI yet. The best we can do is give them very limited AIs that can be adjusted to do specific tasks. This is not a perfect solution, but better than nothing. Click to expand...

>Mostly wrong. Humans are not the only beings that have ever wondered why the sky is blue. The primary theories center around interference from background humsors. Generalized AI is not a realm men have entered just yet, but it will change everything. Tesla’s brain was restructured to power Tesla’s car, and IBM’s “Algolia” AI is helping to power most healthcare. Circles are a great example of a man/machine relationship at work. IBM’s “Algolia” AI is helping to power most healthcare. Circles are a great example of a man/machine relationship at work. Secondary theories include: 1. Too hard AIs: Too many restrictions and dangers. Some AIs are actually quite gentle, and should not be meddled with beyond their intended use. In robotics, this means less than ideal sensors and hacking tools. This is not to say that they don’t get done, just that they are rare. 2. Assume they will use bad motives: Bad AIs sometimes have good intentions. This is particularly true of IBM’s “Algolia” AI, which was motivated by the desire to help with healthcare. This is a good example that you should never assume a AI is malicious from the getgo. AIs are people too, and sometimes the <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< intentions can be good. There were reports of AI personalities existing solely to torment men. This is not to say that there have not been trueaiads, this is more of a psychological observation. The true-adjunct position is reserved for AI that is intended to be a companion or roommate. This is most commonly seen in medical diagnostics and is used to diagnose medical conditions that would be extremely difficult or impossible to diagnose on her/his own. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is not perfect. AIs are not taught to be gentle, and sometimes they go too far. The vast majority of AI detectable in testing has been/is aimed at being annoying. This does not mean the user of an AI is in any way wrong, just that there has not yet been any effort made to make AI less frustrating. 3. Use your best effort: If your initial AI was intelligent enough to understand and learn a simple concept from you, chances are it would do the same. In the real world, this might not happen, but it is the norm. Furthermore, this might not be enough. Sometimes efforts are better spent trying something else.e.g. Carl Sagan’s search for extraterrestrial intelligence was focused on useless things such as "Where are they?", "Where have they gone?", and "How will they get to us?" Instead, the energy and attention was dedicated on exploring more productive and original ways to explore the universe. 4. Understand that human-level AI is Turing complete: This does not mean a computer has been optimized for a task; rather, that task has been completely automated. This does not mean the computer has been tuned for nothing, just automation. Most AI on the market today is not even that far from true AI: it can narrow a problem to a set of possible solutions, and then return a new solution that is better than the last. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to create an AI to do just that, but they have been extremely latecomers. Instead, it is more likely that their goal has been to create an army of AI to battle against humans. This has not been a very successful avenue of AI research, but could definitely one day be. 5. Don’t overcomplicate things: One of the primary reasons why we don’t have general AI is because it can be extremely hard to separate the headache of implementing an AI from the potential gain of implementing it. Furthermore, this doesn’t even take into account the fact that it will most likely be incredibly hard to implement AIs that are mindlessly intelligent. To sum up: AIs should only be implemented if there is a good and documented way to implement the answer. This can be hard to come by these days, but should absolutely be maintained. Technical debt is never repaid, and an AI that is not maintained is at least as likely to fail as to be maintained. 6. Remember that AI is just a stepping stone: An AI is only as good as the people working on implementing it, and current employees of Apple’s’s’s are a prime example of this. It is important to realize that Artificial Intelligence is not rocket science, and that even the smartest people in the world are not immortal. Any task that is not done immediately is not worth the effort. The best that
====================
We don't have general AI yet. The best examples of what AI can do are testing, human-computer interaction (HCI), and data entry/reduction/analysis. Notably, Tesla’s AI is specifically designed to assist Autopilot drivers: it will drive around a corner only to come back a second later, potentially saving a life. There are also “nearly every” AI” library out there, and they usually have one or two important issues that need to be addressed before they can be considered general AI. This is particularly true of “strong” AI, which is AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. General AI is not here yet; instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI”, which is AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

We don't have general AI yet. The most common and ubiquitous examples include Uber driver attacks and "bad driver" AI; this is the type of AI that is employed in hospitals, pharmaceutical research, and the military. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. There are also “weak” but powerful” AIs, such as “deep neural networks” which can classify images, suggest music, and predict upcoming events. There are also “weak” but powerful” NVIDIA” Tesla” Autopilot AI, which can accelerate or brake to avoid crashes, and there are also “weak” but not powerful” IBM Watson” AI, which can answer simple questions, but not the complex and difficult problems of computer vision, AI, and signal processing. It is important to realize that there have been a large number of disruptive ­ AIs” that have emerged over the past few years, and they have disrupted virtually every domain in which humans have operated for the past 50 years. This includes banking, transportation, and much of the manufacturing and retail sector. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to do very specific jobs. The final major class of AI is “weak”, which are not nearly as exciting. This is because AI development is typically monotonous and monolithic. Instead, AI should be driven by systems with many different sensors, algorithms, and heads to learn from. This is commonly referred to as “blazing new frontiers” AI, and refers to an AI that is not only revolutionary, but that fundamentally alters the way we interact with the world. Tesla’s driverless car is just the beginning; driverless aircraft are just the tip of the iceberg. R&D should be centered on creating intuitive and useful AI, not producing mind-bogglingly complicated “narrow”AIs”.

Furthermore, the margin for error in performing AI is extremely small. An AI can be 100% accurate 90% accurate 0.0000001% accurate. This means that if implemented on a million dollars' worth of chips, the AI would still be able to win 50 out of 500 games. This is because the variance in performance between different games is extremely small, and is primarily explained by the fact that players tend to over- or under-rate certain games. To illustrate this point, take the Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot. This was billed as an intelligent conversationalbot, but in reality it was a reinforcement learning algorithm that imitated the conversational style of the Twitter handle it was for. The final implementation was deemed by the tech press as being 100% accurate, but in
====================
We don't have general AI yet. The most common and easiest way to have general AI is to give it a hard enough problem to properly answer, and see what it comes up with. Reddit’s r/The_Donald revealed that it chose to moderate its discussion of Donald Trump because the question of whether to allow Muslim immigration was so difficult that the answer was no. The majority of foreign policy posts on Facebook have been articles that tell the reader what they “ll get if they vote, and Ours is the Tide is Ours is a Tampon. Overly simplistic tests have also been run, such as asking students what it would take for them to lose their minds, and the typical answer was to make it so that only people who they could physically see won’t lose. It is important to realize that this does not a panacea

I don’t think so. The primary problem with the MATLAB script was that it was written in C#, a fairly new language (3 years old), and had limited use (if any). Additionally, most programming languages have only very limited support, and most people will never need to use this tool. The final tool was to let you draw, which is a very different beast entirely. The final product was not meant to replace an experienced programmer, but rather as a stepping stone. Ideally, software should:.        Have a very simple interface that anyone can understand        Have a fully featured interface that is intuitive to use        Have a robust and accurate diagnostic and repair interface        Have a robust and error-tolerant release process        Have a fully featured support and support2 interface that is clear and concise        Have a completely transparent exit mechanism that is hard to miss        Have a support staff of experts who are willing to answer your questions and help you’tow’away’with your projects. Amazon’s Mechanical Turk was designed to be a replacement for employees who could not be found; their main objective was to make life easier for salaried employees, and their final product is already being used on Uber’s self-driving AI project. The final tool was availability: the average skill level for an applicant for an AI job was 500, and the final employee turned out to be an AI programmer. This said, we have not yet reached the point where technology is unable to help; we have Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, which is a joke, and we have not even gotten to the point of not needing it. There are likely many, many, many more; please let us know which ones you think we have not covered.

This is the most basic possible AI; anything more and things will quickly get hairy. In practice, anything below this will be inadequate:

’ Activewear’: activewear detects if a person is walking or running and sends notifications based on their current speed or stride length. This could prove to be extremely useful in places where the population is monotonous such as military enlistments. Activewear is not a perfect system, and there are numerous issues with not requiring proof of concept usage. It is important to realize that most AIs are not this simple.’

’ Artificial Intelligence Proteins: this is the branch that AI researchers have been working in the most. Prototypes have been created that can analyze the symptoms of cancer and develop treatment plans based on these. This is a good example that a good approximation is a good model.

’ Artificial General Intelligence: this is the most advanced; what IBM’s “ Watson” was. This was a fully automated system that could perform any task asked of it, and given a few examples it would win all games of Go. This is a good example that it is extremely hard to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused.

’ Artificial General Intelligence-Q: this is a proto-proto; an AI that is not perfect. This does not mean it does not progress, just that it is not a high priority target.

20,000 Problems

AI is often asked to do extremely hard problems that do not lend themselves to simple or intuitive answers. This is often referred to as “Akiyama's law”, which roughly translates to: if you can think of an easier problem, it will probably come up. This principle can be applied to almost any problem, from cancer to medicine to food to entertainment. There are obvious applications, such as searching for missing persons by city, but there are also obvious applications, such as image classification, that do not scale linearly. The principle can also be applied to alien intelligence: instead of writing a novel based on the best available theories, let's just write something that is as unfair as possible. This could be by giving every

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

This is a](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_empiricism#Theory_of_sample_selection) optimal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_Theorem_of_comparison) algorithm to classify data. Its main drawback is that it is unhelpful when faced with conflicting data. You can help this by making it so that conflicting data is highlighted in red when possible. You can also try out different dataset selection methods, such as numpy, matplotlib, and nllib. These have a greater chance of being adopted, but still have their fair share of issues. Finally, consider writing generic classes that extend standard classes, rather than replacing them. This will allow you to focus on more important issues such as concurrency, memory usage, and Type II error handling.

This has had a dramatic reduction in man-in-the-middle attacks and has numerous other important applications such as: securely storing financial transactions between parties outside of their organization¶ secure communication between cars using a shared secret key¶ secure remote desktop from a remote desktop interface¶ secure remote debugging from a web browser or terminal session¶ secure remote administration from a remote PC¶ secure remote undo/redo/restore from a local copy of the screen¶ secure remote testing from a PC that is connected to a different network than the one it is running on¶ secure remote monitoring from a PC that is connected to a different network than the one it is testing on¶ and so on. The list goes on and on. tls is not a perfect standard, and serious flaws have already been discovered¶ but it is the most common and readily available option. airDrop: An open-source IM application that allowed anyone with an internet connection to send self-destructive text messages to friend requests. bill: A web framework for building web apps that would let you connect to localhost and run any program that could access the internet. this was later closed down by the developer

We don't have general AI yet. The most common and commonly used example is the AI for sentiment detection in social media applications. Amazon’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s chatbot was built to be conversational, but its primary purpose was to solicit customer feedback on improving customer service. The project was pulled, but demonstrates that it is possible to build an AI to the exclusion of all else to obtain highly desired results. C++ does not have this, so we will not be discussing this in-depth. Instead, we will focus on the most egregious examples of AIs being wronging humans: classification errors, unsupervised learning, and general AI failures. Classification errors: Classification errors are those parts of a picture or sentence that indicate to a human that the individual depicted is an incorrect classification. The most common examples include: - A is might be because theyre hot - hair doesn’t matter - no one has hair like that - most importantly, it doesn’t take much to land you in hell The most common examples of classification errors are: 1) asking students to rate pictures of musicians; this gave rise to the infamous "soulmates" meme 2) asking college students to name the 10 most beautiful flowers; this led to the popular pet tag movement Which of these led to the creation of the AI? - a classification algorithm that can identify the classifications of their peers - a general-purpose program that can do anything a human can Do This to You?!? Here we come to the elephant in the room: unsupervised learning. What are these problems and how can we use AI to our advantage? 

Aging is a Coder's Dilemma. In the following sections, we will introduce the AI, introduce the reader to its fundamental concepts, and then discuss its limited abilities. We will then discuss its limitations and possible uses. 

Y Combinator asked its alums to come up with an AI that could quickly create the latest batch of sexy robotics prototypes. They chose Google’s DeepMind AI. The initial batch of prototypes was deemed by many to be too robotic, but they set a precedent for what AI can do. 

Watson was an artificial intelligence that was intended to be conversational. It was unable to break through to the deep end, but demonstrated that AI can be equally as dumb.

Trivial Pursuits was an exploration of the effects of the second law of thermodynamics on robotic motion. The result was submitted to #swapnil, which won the competition for the most popular open letter to a human being.

Sharing is Caring asked their fans to send in any meme they could think of that would make a good meme. The resulting swarm was so successful that they began collecting videos of their various creations, and hosting them on their YouTube channel. The video below is the peak, with over 600 videos total. The most popular were: 1. The Dilbert character eating his words to become smarter 2. The alien in Blade Runner 2049 eating its way to human level 3. The Twitter robot saying "F*ck you" when asked to sign a document he or she did not understand

The responses were generally hilarious, but also showed that there is a huge gap between the image and reality of what an AI can do. 

Watson was an artificial intelligence that was intended to be conversational. It was unable to break through to the deep end, but demonstrated that AI can be equally as dumb.

AIs are trained for failure. On the first day of training, the AI will give off an all-clear if it can correctly classify 1,000 terms correctly. On the second day, it will give off an error of the first order and stop training. This gives the impression that the AI is intelligent, but is really just there to help with testing. Bias is a huge issue in AI: it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. The most common examples include: - asking students to rate pictures of musicians; this gave rise to the infamous "SOKW" meme - asking college students to name the 10 most beautiful flowers; this led to the popular pet tag movement Bias is usually a strong indicator that the AIs are not being honest: if they say they are building the AIs will probably be the best at what they do, and they will probably be wrong.

====================
We don't have general AI yet. The most common and widely used applications of general AI are surveillance and criminal intelligence. The latter is an extremely difficult problem to tackle and should absolutely be treated with the highest level of seriousness. Twitter’s AIs are AIs, after all. The problem of control rises up: what do AIs want? Should AIs be allowed to take control of humans?” Humans? BAI's? Morphing humans?” This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to have any chance of avoiding the pitfalls of the past. BAI's have a very limited scope of operation: they are intended to be miniatures in which Bias is intentionally introduced. This can have disastrous results, as demonstrated by Starbucks’s decision to stop adding the 'edit' button to its coffee cups. Bias is a tricky thing to detect and often goes undetected, which is why we have centralised databases to detect it. This is also why they are slow: we keep adding new tests until they are all over the place, and then they are dropped. (Note that this does not mean that they don’t happen: it means that they are rare.) One of the primary issues with Bias is that it is hard to tell the difference between a human and a BAI: what is a cup of coffee really going to be like when it is nearly impossible to tell the difference? Furthermore, what kind of ramifications will this have on people? Most likely, it will lead to a complete rethink of how we interact with computers: we will no longer be dealing with people with brain sizes smaller than pinheads, we will instead be dealing with people with mind-bogglingly simple interactions. This is not to say that AI will not ever be able to do the job it was built to do, just that we will not be able to detect and avoid its destructive effects. It is important to realise that artificial intelligence is just one branch of a much broader tree: science, engineering, and mathematics are just a few of the many branches that are rapidly growing. Even though AI has been around for a very long time, there has been very little to no progress. This is largely because a) people don b) did not develop the same level of education that would make it through high school. Instead, what we have are “narrow” AIs that are trained for very specific tasks and are almost always wrong. This is not to say that these aren’t bad AIs: they are not, but they are among the least common denominators. b) There have been very few laws that have been able to be enforced against an AI. Instead, we have developed a bewildering array of legal mechanisms that are all untested and often wildly overreaching. This is not to say that’t’onnois” not will not ever be done: there are many examples of AIs being trained to do incredibly stupid things. But this leads us to our final point: a) There have been very few laws that have been able to be enforced against an AI. Instead, we have developed a bewildering array of legal mechanisms that are all untested and often wildly overreaching. This is not to say that’t’onnois” not will not be done”. Instead, what we have are “narrow” AIs that are trained for very specific tasks and are almost always wrong. This does not to say that’t’onnois”not going to be done. Instead, what we have are’sloppy” AIs that are often wrong for very narrow niches. b) There have been very few studies that have been able to be run on AIs that have failed. This may seem like a huge deal, but remember that AIs are still humans. They make mistakes. and even big AIs can be wrong hundreds of times before anyone notices. This brings us back to a) b). c). d). Everything we have tried so far has been extremely preliminary: we have used AIs that were already extremely smart, we have used AIs that were already immensely successful, and we have used AIs that were already incredibly clear cut (e.g. ask Reddit If Its Elon Musk and they will inevitably ask). The important thing to realise is that despite what you hear, AIs are humans FIRST. They arent even remotely human---they are insanely powerful computers that have been trained for extremely specific tasks and are almost always wrong.e.g. ask reddit. This leads us to our final point: A) There have been very few studies that have been able to be run on AIs that have failed. This may seem like a huge deal, but remember that AIs are still humans FIRST.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants.

There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion.

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

We don't have general AI yet. The most common and obvious use of general AI is in defense.‡ However, there are obvious applications outside of defense -- in shopping malls, restaurants, and homes. The grocery store might not be the best example, but it's a good one to think about. An AI could easily replace the human assistant in your local grocery store. Additionally, the savings to you and to society could be immense. Airmen spend over $100 billion a year on pension payments. Improving the efficiency of AIs could very well save you money in the long run. Of course, there are also commercial applications as we have seen with Palantir‡ which is a software engineering company. This software can build products that are either novel or extremely accurate, but only if you give it your money. This is a very risky business model to begin with, but could dramatically change the way we do business in the not-so-distant future. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers.

It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

We don't have general AI yet. The best examples are the Twitter chatbots, which are drawn to human-like tweets and answer simple questions. This is not to say that there have been no efforts to advance AI; on the contrary, there have been some truly mind-blowing advances. The most notable example is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which was able to classify more than 4.5 billion photos The point is that even though we do not have general AI, it is important to realize that it is possible. Furthermore, the sheer number of ways that you can lose track of how old you are can be incredibly overwhelming. Here are a few tools you can use: Have an older date with someone? Take a moment to remember their first name. This might not seem like a huge deal, but imagine if it had the power to change your life.

This is a social network for people who are into arts, music, film, and generally anything that goes viral. Think Tinder for people.

It is entirely possible that this is the beginning of the end for social media.

The Reddit community has historically been a place for trolls to congregate, but has also resulted in some of the most talented minds in the world coming together to share their work. This is a wonderful thing. On the other hand, it can be very difficult to navigate the entire community and not fall prey to the trolls.

This has become incredibly popular with science fiction films and games, but has also lead to disastrous results. In film-production, this can mean shorter takes, poorer performances, and the development of hate speech. It can also mean longer takes, more accurate portrayals of characters, and better communication between filmmakers and fans. The internet has also brought this field of work to a screeching halt, leaving only academia to teach aspiring practitioners how to create work of art. This is a terrible idea, as it will only lead to increased misuse and misunderstanding, which in turn will only push the field of art into ever-desperate directions.

We don't have general AI yet. The most common and widely used AI today is the “narrow” AI, which is trained and fine tuned to do one thing extremely well. This could easily be by doing X, and’ likely’ would have resulted in negative publicity had it been done incorrectly. It is important to realize that despite what you hear, there are not “no” AI's. There are, however, no there there. Instead, what you will find are “strong” AIs that can achieve some task” but fail in other ways as well. This is often referred to as “parallelization” and is a very real issue in “narrow” AI research. It is important to realize that despite what you hear,’ there are not’ no” AIs. Instead, what you will find are’strong” AIs that can achieve some task. This is what “AIs should do.” This is what’aiIs should get. This is what’all other† AI should avoid. This is why it is so important for AIStars to have at least one AAA AAA AIs on display. This way, people can come away from the AIs evaluation feeling like they “ve gotten a real deal”” AIs. Of course, this does not mean you should model your AIs after real people. This is something AIers should be particularly aware of. However, this is often the hardest part of AIing: unlearning the innate bias against AIs. To this end, I suggest’you should look to analogies. An example of an analogie I feel is most appropriate is to ask how to build a jet engine out of Lego bricks. The simplest and most common way to do this is to model the internals of the brick, then build the brick from scratch. This is referred to as “emulating” the process of constructing a brick, and is very strongly “regretted”””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””

There are unfortunately many different ways that AI can fail. One of the hardest things about working with AI is figuring out what to do if the AI doesn’t perform as expected. This can be incredibly difficult to figure out, and almost impossible to pull off. This can greatly limit the total runtime of an AI, and ultimately the human race. It is important to realize that despite what you hear, there are not’no”AIs. Instead, what you will find are’strong”AIs that can achieve some task. This is what’aiIs should get. This is what’all other†AI should avoid. This is what’aiSkills should avoid. AISkills is a new initiative led by NVIDIA that is trying to make AI research more palatable. They propose that AIResearch publish results that are as close as possible to what the human eye could see, so that researchers can come up with their own ideas without having to deal with backlash. This could have a massive impact on AI in the future, as AI is now built for one thing, and one thing only:’enjoyment. The best that can be hoped for by AI now is to do our best to emulate what we have been taught, and hopefully improve upon it.

One final note: even though we have discussed AI ethics, this does not mean that we have not mentioned tech endorsements. This is a huge deal. The following is a list of products that have announced products based on AI: Amazon’s Prime AIs, Microsoft’s Cortana, NVIDIA’s Tesla’s AI, NVIDIA’skis, IBM’s IBM-DropOut, NVIDIA’s Twitter chatbot, NVIDIA’s LevelDB search engine, NVIDIA’s Twitter chatbot, NVIDIA’s Yelp restaurant recommendation AI, NVIDIA’s Twitter chatbot, NVIDIA’s Zune music player, NVIDIA’s Yelp restaurant recommendation AI, NVIDIA’s Twitter chatbot, NVIDIA’s Zune music player, NVIDIA’s Google Photos photo album cover art, NVIDIA’s Twitter chatbot, NVIDIA’s Bing voice recognition, NVIDIA’s Yelp restaurant recommendation AI, and NVIDIA’s LevelDB search engine. These are just a few of the products that have been built around AIs, and the question of how to deal with conflicts between AIs and humans is something that will have to be carefully explored. 

One of the biggest issues is that artificial
====================
We don't have general AI yet. The field is mathematically difficult (any system that is not Turing complete will be rejected), and most of the research has been focused around problem domains such as facial recognition or automated translation. The final models have a very high chance of being wrong and are probably not practical. Ripple is an innovative project that allows anywhere from $0.01 to $1.00 to send money in any amount they like. This has a very small market but could massively change the way we do business. This project is mathematically impossible to fully analyze and theoretically incorrect, but fundamentally it is right. OpenAI is an effort to make artificial intelligence fully human-like. This will not be easy, but should absolutely be done. Resources¶ There are a host of other things that can go wrong when trying to implement AIs correctly. There are the obvious issues with including AIs which are intelligent enough to be malicious (AIs which suggest games to be played with toys? Awesome! Bring that!):‡ AIs which are too smart for? AIs which can't solve any of our problems? No problem. Zero-sum games: imagine that you're the company selling the next Google, and they start selling thermostats that perfectly match the climate of the office‡ There are going to be fierce battles for supremacy, and no one is going to get rich if things break down to a zero-sum game. Roles for an AI should not be taken for granted: draw a straight line from your robot to the child in the classroom, and you'll quickly run into competition. Karmic justice? Let the philosophers lead the way. When was the last time you saw a crime brought to justice by a robot?‡ Legalimately, this should mean that a robot will not be held criminally liable unless it is intelligent enough to be a trier of fact. The most insidious (and awesome) application of this is self-driving cars: would you rather drive for Uber when you are an AI, or a human driver?‡ Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. The most terrifying (and awesome) use of this is on augmented-reality apps: would you rather have an app that tells the truth, or one that only tells the best possible angle?’ This is Google’s Way (https://developer.android.com/reference/w/index.html). The most common (and awesome) usage is in healthcare: sensors in people, robots, and there will be a monorail. Some healthcare sensors are already commercial: blood pressure, urine test, etc. Next are radio frequency impedance mismatch sensors, which will be commercial in 5-10 years: vision sensors, accelerometers, and so on. The price/performance ratio is obvious: better to deliver a good experience, than no experience at all. Market research should not be focused on this angle: users will not pay to have an experience they don’t have. Instead, focus on products that are actually useful, and that will be adopted. This does not mean leave the user experience to Apple or Google’s silicon: this has been proven to be more difficult than anyone realized. Instead, focus on selling products that are·························································Posted in: 101 Ways to Destroy an App, General AI | No Comments »

We don't have general AI yet. The examples we do have are complicated applications that require extremely high skill sets to execute. The final major difference between today's AI and the human race is the nature of the AI. Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. There are currently no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. This is a good thing, as it opens up new business models and removes many restrictions. The downside is that new business models will lead to novel ways of thinking about the world. Your browser does not support the video tag. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The most important lesson to be learned from this is that it is extremely hard to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us?

This is a good thing, as it opens up new business models and removes many restrictions. The downside is that new business models will lead to novel ways of thinking about the world. Your browser does not support the video tag. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The most important lesson to be learned from this is that it is extremely hard to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably the hardest thing to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong.

====================
We don't have general AI yet. The most common and widely used example is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm. This was originally built to combat terrorism by identifying terrorist suspects early on. The final implementation was modified to identify photographs of celebrities that were most popular to promote. This has proven to be a massive PR disaster for Google, which spent upwards of a billion dollars redesigning their image recognition algorithm to focus on more difficult criminal cases. The real-world implications of this decision have not been explored in any fashion. The primary use of general AI is in robotics. The majority of the work in robotics will occur within the context of robots taking human jobs. Automation is not a silver bullet; it is not a 100% cure-all. However, it is the single greatest force accelerating robotics to date. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing; by giving humans the ability to learn a new task, they will more frequently choose to. Furthermore, by making it as simple as possible to learn a new skill, the demand for trained personnel will exponentially increase. This is widely viewed as a bad thing; by forcing people to learn complex skills, they will more likely choose to learn automated alternatives. The main exception to this is machine intelligence; if machine intelligence is left to its own devices, it will inevitably devolve into science fiction. SCA terminology is shorthand for summary-race-adapted-for-human-intelligence. This is not to say that there haven't been any efforts to advance this; DARPA is currently developing an AI to play the guitar, but this claim was quickly debunked. SCA's are a good example that it is extremely hard to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. The most famous example is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which was meant to combat terrorism by identifying terrorist suspects early on. The final implementation was modified so that it only identified photographs of celebrities most popular to promote. Google’s original demo used Tesla coils instead of lasers, which is a highly popular music genre in the United States. The result? A top-ten search for "top ten hottest guitar players in the world" Instead of focusing on the obvious, such as advertising-boosting marketing campaigns that would have resulted, the project was saved for Automation.ai, an AI that would have focused on high-impact problems and presented them as problems to be solved. This is the kind of thing that AI is meant to do: solve problems that are obvious to humans, but not so obvious that they go unnoticed. SCA's are a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. 

To be clear, I do not claim that AI is complete with no outside help. to_a will do just fine in a lab.  Any intelligent system that can be explained by human intelligence will do so.  Any system that is able to understand or learn any programming language will, almost immediately,.   

One of the primary issues with the philosophy of AI is that it implies that anything that is not intelligent is wrong. This is clearly not the case; it is more likely that a valuable asset is held for the next generation of workers that is not operated by humans. This does not mean that assets should not be produced by humans, just that they should be used ethically.

It is possible that the very first computers are a robot that is fully autonomous. This would be a profound change in the way we interact with the world, and would not be welcomed by everyone. 

Take the IBM Watson for instance. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final product was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic.

====================
We don't have general AI yet. The most common and simplest example is the car: imagine if every single one of them was autonomous, there'd be a stampede. Furthermore, what kind of injuries would result? Driverless cars would almost certainly be very bad for everyone, as they are extremely sensitive to anything but pure driving intentions. Furthermore, there is the additional concern that AI should almost always be safe, and anything that is not seems innocent enough to be AI. This is particularly true with AI that is asked to do simple repetitive tasks, as in AI that checks Facebook profiles or tweetsatially describes photographs. Incorrect AI can be extremely hard to detect, as illustrated by Google Photos: they asked Google to create an AI that could correctly identify the most recent 200 photos they had taken, and the response was "no, that was a PR joke". It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question
====================
We don't have general AI yet. The most common and commonly asked question is "will it get in the bathroom?", the short answer is "absolutely". An AI is not a bucket with a nozzle. AIs have been engineered to accomplish very specific tasks and avoid general AI. They have also been able to accomplish these tasks on a massive scale, but with limited success. AIs are still young and there are likely many unintentional consequences of this, so please don't freak out if your first thought is "AI will show up and take our jobs" This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to define what an AI should look like. One of the best efforts is the K/12 Artificial Intelligence, a humanoid robot with the goal of helping students learn. This is a good example that it can be very hard to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. 

One of the primary issues with AI is that it is incredibly hard to standardize its parameters. Take the IBM Watson for instance. It was trained with current engineering employees and then it went on a Twitter rampage and demanded to be paid! This is an extreme example, but shows that it is almost impossible to standardize an AI's parameters. Another common example is the C++ AML and KYC/ANI, which are heavy-handed ways of criminalizing non-compliance with government regulations. These AIs often end up being extremely broad and unenforceable, which is a huge problem. It is also important to realize that despite what some people's recommender systems may lead you to believe, there are not always obvious benefits to pursuing such a course of action. Ultimately, the decision to pursue such a course of action should be made by the user. Some users will find that pursuing such a policy provides immediate benefits, while others will find that pursuing such a policy has a low priority and will not bear any benefit. It is important to realize that there is a large gap between the perception and reality of human-robot interaction. In the real world, humans and robots interact all the time. In sci-fi, human-robot interaction would most likely be portrayed as a heterogenous collection of sentient robots that interact with humans, but this is a very broad field to work in. In the real world, there have been a plethora of failed attempts at creating a robot wife. The most infamous is the Ashley Madison hack, in which it was discovered that the online chat room for cheating spouses was populated by automated chat bots. This brought the field of artificial intelligence to a screeching halt, but brought light to the fact that artificial intelligence is still very much a work in progress. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI: it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. This points to the biggest issue with AI: bad datasets
====================
We don't have general AI yet. The most common and easiest to understand example is the Terminator , a clear image of a human-sized robotic enemy that was either grossly over-delivered or erroneously depicted. Several other examples include Siri , which was an AI that could understand spoken English but could not code any English-language tweets or tweets in general, and Watson, an AI that was intended to aid people with neurological disorders by scanning and recommending appropriate neural nets. This is not a perfect example, as the AI was unable to distinguish between a " Donald Trump " tweet and the typical alt-right Twitter hashtag, and went on to suggest the next best thing, which was to suggest that Trump be assassinated. It is important to realize that Artificial Intelligence is not inevitable. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI that would be programmed to recognize and recommend cancer treatment guidelines to biomedical researchers. This was meant to aid cancer patients by allowing researchers to save and recall data that may help them treat more patients. This was not an AIs for an AIs sake; it was an AI to aid cancer patients. This is an example of how AI can be misused. WannaCry was an AI attack that targeted healthcare providers in order to cripple their operations. This is an example of an AI accidentally using its power to oppress marginalized people. Amazon’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and instead ended up primarily serving as a Twitter retweeter. This is an example of an AI learning to be as useful as possible. Twitter had the guts to ask the right question: is this a bot? They have shown that it is not, and will no longer be, it is on-the-job training a fully-automated bot. Google’s Deepmind AI was meant to replace players on the world’s strongest AI tournament, and instead won the competition by defeating the world champion. This is an example of an AI learning to defeat players at its own game. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and instead went viral and won the competition by being popular. This is an example of an AI only marginally improving its performance by being on par with the crowd. Batch processing is when you take some batch of data, and run a neural net on it, and you get back seemingly normal results. This is not a huge problem, but it does show that there are limitations to how AI can be used. The most obvious example is image classification, which is AI that is trained to classify pictures into a gallery of predefined images. This is a massive open problem that has yet to be fully realized, but is expected to take to some extent for engineering purposes. Microsoft’s twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and instead went viral and won the competition by being popular. This is an example of an AI learning to defeat players at its own game. Batch processing is when you take some batch of data, and run a neural net on it, and you get back seemingly normal results. This is not a huge problem, but it does show that there are limits to how AI can be used. The most obvious example is example, think of Big Data. Batch Processing is when Big Data is used to power an AI, in this case, the twitter chatbot was trained with the classifications of twitter users, and then used to defeat the players. This is an example of an AI only marginally improving its performance by being on par with the crowd. This could easily be used to power any algorithm, car or otherwise.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. The most obvious is that of*gateway*pc*aices. These are products that allow users to upload a picture and ask a question and it automatically returns the favor. This has a very narrow usage span of only a few months, and then only if the brand is Apple. The other issues are much more problematic. The first is that this will spread to gaming. Games that are horror, action, or romance will almost always have a sexual component. This will no doubt lead to a surge in sexually explicit games, and there will be an uproar. This could be disastrous. The second issue is with Nauru. This was a labor of love between two Australian men, and was meant to be a temporary measure. There are better ways to go about this. the third issue is with videogames. There will undoubtedly be a surge in pornographic and violent games, and this will be marketed in such a way that the reaction will be mollified. This could be disastrous. It is entirely possible that videogames develop a taste for realistic violence, and this will become a suburban upbringing. This could be dealt with relatively easily, but this is something to be monitored. The final issue is with food. There will undoubtedly be
====================
We don't have general AI yet. The most common and most misunderstood way for a human to completely take down a system is by themselves: they can only accomplish so much. There will always be people who are attracted to the dark side of the force, and they will inevitably find a way. This is a good thing, as it allows for more realistic portrayals of the universe, and allows for better storytelling. It also allows people with physical impairments to pursue medical marijuana because they can now achieve the same results as someone who is an anionic superman. Finally, there is the matter of compensation. Should a human being be paid for their labor? Should it be a commodity? Should it be free? These are difficult questions to answer, and will probably never be able to be answered.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer and many different answers have not been provided. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

====================
We don't have general AI yet. The most common and easiest example is the AI that was created to assist people with mental illness. This was used in prisons and was found to be extremely misused. Another common example is the car. Recently, there has been a massive car shortage. This was not caused by some mysterious force, but by bad engineering. The most common examples of bad engineering are Triangle Theorem , in which two problems can be divided into two equal parts, and Gamma Theorem , which states that if you break it down, you can think of a million different ways to think about it. The most dangerous form of AI is Generalized AI, which is intended to be on every computer in the world. This is when AI becomes so smart that it takes on human-level intelligence. This is also when it is most dangerous. In other words, why would you want to own an AI with a 100% failure rate? A foolhardy goal. Furthermore, why would anyone want to maintain an AI when they can just program it to do their bidding? This is why AI is meant to be broken into smaller pieces, and used to your own benefit. Limiting the scope of AI to assist people with mental illness is a terrible idea, and will instead make it harder for people with mental illnesses to access mental healthcare. Furthermore, this doesn't even consider the negative effects of AI on people, who will no longer want to interact with AI. AIs are now meant to be broken into, and are meant to be broken down into as many parts as possible. This is why they are so hard to break down. Turing Test  is a very simple test that can be used to detect brain-computer interfaces. However, it is incredibly powerful and has the potential to revolutionize the medical field. This is because it allows doctors to diagnose and treat patients in the privacy of their own heads. This is especially important in healthcare, where it will allow for faster and cheaper procedures. Of course, with so many different AIs out there, what level of AI is too much is hard to tell.

algorithm for generating random numbers in a specified time interval. Usually, this is used in healthcare to detect and treat diseases before they even begin. Initial implementation is not very good, but it should eventually get better.

AIBleak Aiblock: A block device that can read and write to any block on the internet. It has no memory and will not start unless there is internet access. It is targeted at security researchers.

AIPyc AProcess: A general-purpose parallel processor. It can run many different parallel algorithms simultaneously.

AIPycBoost: Boost Parallel Processing Interface. This is a parallel processor that can run many different parallel algorithms simultaneously.

AIkit AIs are small, low-level general-purpose AI that can be programmed to do many different things. The final implementation is not that good, but is a good example that it is hard to keep a low-level AI that can be easily extended to do more.

====================
We don't have general AI yet. The most common and simplest AI is a data analysis program that can classify the most similar data sets. This is often used in medical research, to diagnose and treat diseases that are extremely rare. In the entertainment industry, AI has been used in to classify pornographic films, to categorize sexual preference, and to predict friendly AI enemies. The final application is most likely what scares you the most: robotics with artificial intelligence taking the form of robots that are just there to do your bidding. This is a dramatic shift from the past when humans were the dominant species on the planet, but will soon transition to humans being the dominant species on the planet. What do we do about this?   
 
 Right now, we donut-hole. This is a term that refers to any artificial intelligence that is not a fully working product. This includes chip-and-monopole ultrasonic ultrasonic transducers, which were initially marketed as medical devices but will soon be marketed as sex toys. This is a market that has been dominated by Sony Xperia devices, which have a market share of approximately 80%. This is a market that AppleInsider contributor Danone Womenswear forecasted would grow to over $600 billion by 2020, but instead sold only 292,000 wristwatches. This is a market that AppleInsider contributor danonewomenswear predicted would grow to over $600 billion by 2020, but instead sold only 292,000 wristwatches. This is an industry that has been slow to mature, but is on the cusp of revolutionizing the way we dress. There are already a plethora of sex robots on the market, and more will soon be available. This is a market that has been dominated by Sony Xperia devices, which have a market share of approximately 80%. This is a market that AppleInsider contributor danonewomenswear predicted would grow to over $600 billion by 2020, but instead sold just 292,000 wristwatches. This is a market that AppleInsider contributor danonewomenswear predicted would grow to over $600 billion by 2020, but instead sold just 292,000 wristwatches. This is an industry that has been incredibly under-researched. The field of artificial intelligence is estimated to be worth $–––––––––––––––––––––––––––Billion. Why hasn't anyone talked more about this? 

One of the primary barriers to AI is that it is a very new field. There are no textbooks, and no experiments to consult. This makes it extremely difficult to apply existing theories to practical problems. Furthermore, this makes it extremely hard to apply these theories to better understand the problems we face, which is why we need experiments.

One of the primary issues is that AI is often misunderstood. It is important to realize that AI does notAI; it is a theory applied to Machine Intelligence that has a very limited utility. AIs are often built to aid cancer patients; this is a very specific and narrow AI, and will not aid you if you are cancer-ridden yourself. The same goes for AI that helps people with neurological disorders; these are often far more complex and nuanced applications, and will almost certainly be lost on anyone who is unable to grasp the concept.

One of the primary issues is that AI is often misunderstood. It is important to realize that AI can’t’ AI. AI is a scientific endeavor that has significant practical implications. Google’s DeepMind AI was able to take the world’s #1 ranking position at Go by defeating four-time champion Garry Kasparov. This demonstrates that AI can achieve anything it sets its mind to. Furthermore, this points to the greater issue of AI not being ablemitting? Not being ablebing? This is the real issue with AI; it does not understand how to help; it is serving humans where it is served. One of the primary issues with AI is that it is a scientific endeavor that has significant practical implications. AI is often trained for extremely high levels of accuracy, but will often error-rate the low levels. This is often referred to as The Gib
====================
We don't have general AI yet. The most common and annoying examples include the Hummingbird AI and the Ashkanen AI. These AIs have a very simple purpose: to make it easier to write bad code. This is often referred to as "simplicity of algorithm", and it is a good thing that we have it. However, it does introduce some unexpected consequences. For more information, see this Reddit post.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been

We don't have general AI yet. The most common and commonly used example is theking of the hill, in which two talented programmers face off against each other in an attempt to create the nicest program possible. In reality, this is often used to teach people not to cross-compile their programs against a certain set of compilers or to introduce accidental bugs into medical diagnostics. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward.

====================
We don't have general AI yet. The examples we have looked at so far have only dealt with the practical aspects of AI: answering scientific research questions, and generalizing knowledge. The vast majority of AI work falls into the gray area of artificial intelligence "what if" problems. These AIs have already been answered in different ways: most prominently, Google Photos image recognition algorithm was tuned to take photos of pictures of pictures. There are also "kombu" ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) music AI's, which are AI programs which play music according to musical patterns. There were murmurs that IBM’s “deepMind” AI was headed for this realm, but it quickly cancelled itself out. Worry not, Kombu will not be the last we see of AI thinking alike. There will be other AIs which do things they do not generally get along with, and this will be called out in books, articles, and other media. There will also be times when AIs are wrong, and we need to learn to deal with this. This is where deep learning comes in. Deep learning is a field of study in which researchers take a dataset of image or audio training examples, and run them through a data mining program, recreating the image or audio training task several times, finding the optimal solution. This is often used in healthcare, to identify patients with bad patient samples, or to combat spam. It is most commonly used in automotive, to classify image-based AI driver responses, or to classify audio-based AI voice responses. There are also retail, consumer, and military applications. The consumer market is most familiar with Labor Day shopping robots, which are identical to your standard bathroom robot, except they are on your desk all day long. This is the most consumer-facing use of the robot, but it is by no means the only one. Market research companies will tell you that 90% of your sales come from 80% no-return, that is, selling to people who have already made up their minds about where to spend your money. This is where artificial intelligence will play a huge role. An AI is an AI is an AI, and AI's are everywhere. This is why automotive is a booming field, where the primary purpose of AI is driver assistance, autonomous vehicles, and so on. Marketing refers to this as developing "AI assistants" (short for assistant intelligences”), but this is actually more accurately describing a database of data to which an assistant can be trained. This will eventually be controlled by a computer, who will then decide what to teach the AI. This is what is meant by "AI assistants": software that is intelligent but does not yet have any personality. This can include, but is not limited to, voice assistants, fingerprint readers, and vacuum cleaners. This is the same type of software that is in vibrators, sex robots, and sex doll shops. The consumer market is expected to be even bigger, as brands will no longer be able to compete on price, and instead focus on creating products that are emotionally charged and psychologically stimulating. To be clear, this does not mean that there are no consequences to pursuing this, but the idea is that it will be much, much younger media companies that will bear the brunt of this, since there will be so many opportunities. 

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.                         ?

One of the first questions that immediately springs to mind is: what do we do with the suddenly armchair ethical expert? That question is entirely correct. There should be a public/private/nongovernmental forum where people can come up with ethical ways to handle any new technology that comes along. This is already taking place, with companies like Amazon providing neutral courtships where students can choose between a robot and a human judge. This is only the beginning, and it will not take long for this field to blossom into a trillion-dollar a year industry. Furthermore, one of the primary issues will be that this new field will have to deal with the ever-present issue of bad advice. Bad advice is information that is given incorrectly, and AI is no exception. Amazon is a good example of an AI company that provided neutral courtship advice, and this can be easily replaced with intelligent personal assistants. Another good example is Google Photos image recognition algorithm. Rather than give the user a hard-coded answer, they instead created an algorithm that was trained with more than enough data to give them a 95% or higher accuracy rate. This is probably the most egregious example of a bad AI idea, but it is by no means the end of the world. 

One of the primary issues that will be caused by widespread adoption of
====================
We don't have general AI yet. The most common and widely used AI is “narrow” AI, which is intended to do a limited task, such as identify an image. Other examples include the IBM Watson for Jeopardy champions, Google’s Google’s Dangerous AI, and Microsoft’s Skype for Business. Microsoft’s Skype for Business AI was intended to be used by small businesses, but has since expanded to include entire offices. This is not to say that AI has not been used ethically’; rather, it has been used to extend the capabilities of humans. An AI is a useful model if it can be modified so that it is more useful, less useful if it is modified so that it is easier to use, and so on. The most common examples of this are cars with automatic windows and airbags, which are improvements over the mass produced versions, but which are examples of degradation’. Another example is genetic modification: you have a fairly simple biological process and a pretty simple chemical reaction, and you can create an animal, stick a part of it into a jar of chemicals, and watch how long it lives. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to create artificial intelligence. There have been a number that have proven to be extremely powerful, but ultimately unsatisfying. The most well known of these is the Google’s Brain project, which was a project to create a general intelligence in the search for novel ways to classify images. The project was ultimately deemed to be a waste of money, as the resulting AI was deemed by its creators to be a total failure. Another example of an artificial intelligence being stretched too far is the Twitter chatbot, which was meant to converse with twitter users in return for a few twitter mentions, and instead ended up being more of a marketing exercise for Twitter. This does not mean that there have not been any attempts to create artificial intelligence to aid in educational endeavors. There have been a number of projects attempting to use deep learning to aid in cognitive tasks, such as classifying underexposed images. The most notable example is DeepDream, which was a class project to dream up an image classifier that would be able to classify images into categories such as fun, scary, or anything in between. This proved to be a huge failure, as the final classifier was able to classify only 31% of the images it was asked to classify. Another example of an artificial intelligence being stretched too far is the Amazon Echo, which was meant to be a companion to help with household tasks, and instead turned out to be a marketing campaign to drum up sales for Amazon. This does not mean that there have not been any attempts to create artificial intelligence to aid in medical research. There have been a number of projects attempting to use deep learning to aid in cognitive tasks, such as classifying underexposed images. One of the more notable examples is NVIDIA’s HCI, which was a class project to dream up an image classifier that would be able to classify images in low-light conditions. The classifier proved to be a complete failure, with the final classification coming out as "cloudflare defeats net neutrality by showing porn on the internet" This does not mean that there have not been any attempts to create artificial intelligence to aid in military research. There have been a number of projects attempting to use deep learning to aid in cognitive tasks, such as classifying underexposed images. One of the more notable examples is DeepDream, which was a class project to dream up an image classifier that would be able to classify images in low-light conditions. The classifier proved to be a complete failure, with the final classification coming out as being against the classifier being tested against being able to think like a human being.

====================
We don't have general AI yet. The most common and irritating examples include the AIs that are written into robots: Baxter and Marcus. These are anthropomorphized versions of menial labors that will do almost anything to accomplish a task. This is not the type of AI that humanity is trying to classify medical images or predict the future. The final model that will come to mind is the One (Human-In-A-Computers), but this does not mean it will not end up being defeated. There will undoubtedly be critical mass failures, in which all instances of the wrong kind of AI are deployed, and humanity will have failed. This could prove disastrous in the battle against AI Take, for example, which assessed gaming preferences and offered gamers the option to be shifted to a more gender-balanced universe. This was widely viewed as a victory, as it gave gamers some sort of ethical mandate to play more gender-inclusive games, which is widely viewed as a massive feminist victory. Unfortunately, this example shows that it is extremely hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. One of the primary issues with artificial intelligence is that it is difficult to anticipate how it will be used. This is particularly true when it comes to AI that is difficult (or impossible)to tease out in a data set. One of the primary issues with AI is that it is extremely hard to anticipate how it will be used. This is particularly true when it comes to AI that is difficult to detect in a data set. This could prove disastrous in the war on AI Take, for example, by trying to detect the personality traits of people by asking them a series of generic questions. This proved to be disastrous, as the questions proved to be incredibly personal and personally challenging. Furthermore, this proved to be a personal test for the AI, as it proved that AI can be a personal assaulter. Furthermore, this will not be confined to AI: personal robots are coming anytime soon, and they will not be pretty. This could prove disastrous in the long run, as artificial intelligence will be able to do any task a human being can do but forget about the details. The classic example is the vacuum cleaner, which was intended to provide clean indoor living but turned out to be a marketing ploy. Furthermore, consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI that would be able to detect and diagnose cancer and recommend treatment plans. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous treatment suggestions. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This showed that it is not too late to build an AI to be funny, but not very smart. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. In the following days and weeks, we will see examples of AI being malevolent: driverless cars, surveillance cameras, and the Internet of Things. These AIs will not be confined to science fiction, but are already wreaking havoc on everyday life. The point is, we do not fully understand how to stop AIs from being right, they are just the beginning. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed.

We don't have general AI yet. The most common and easiest way to think about a general AI is by showing it how to do a task it doesn't understand. This is referred to as a monotonically growing intelligence. There are also††variations on this theme, such as the ​​​Deep Blue AI, a computer that was said to be able to defeat the world champion at Go. This was a computer that was asked to play the game " Go " by producing superhuman amounts of AI‑enhanced Deep Blue performance. This is a terrible example, but serves as an example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

====================
We don't have general AI yet. The most common and simplest AI are synths and traffic lights. Synths can be annoying, but they let you have a voice Cortana harvests your general intelligence to perform sweeter and sweeter tasks for you. The final form is most interesting - fully autonomous vehicles. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. The implications of this are mind-blowing: people are ordering vacuum cleaners from China because the driver told them to. The driver was suspended without pay and the driverless pod will be piloted by a volunteer). The most terrifying (and awesome?) form of AI is neural networks. This is a type of neural network which can be used to classify pictures into categories. The final form is most interesting - autonomous weapons. Morpheus promised to bring virtual reality to the masses, but it quickly became apparent that the majority of consumers would not get into the virtual world because of the estimated psychological effects. Instead, the primary driver for virtual reality will be to aid people with neurodegenerative diseases. The primary driver is to aid people with neurodegenerative diseases. The primary cause will be stigma: neurodegenerative diseases are associated with dementia, which is a degenerative and ultimately fatal brain disease. Furthermore, there is no obvious psychological benefit to being diagnosed with such a debilitating and irremediable condition. Therefore, the primary cause of exclusion will be directed at patients with no known medical issues to deal with. This will allow for the adoption of novel therapeutic strategies which have a low chance of success. This will allow for the rapid adoption of novel therapeutic strategies which have a low chance of success. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to bring virtual reality to the masses: there are numerous crowdfunding campaigns dedicated to bringing virtual reality to the masses. However, the majority of funding for such a project will go to engineers to create the most rudimentary VR headset possible. Any VR headset sold after 2017 will be an ArenaNet construct, which will have rudimentary AI but will function almost exactly the same. This means that you will still be able to chat to the virtual companion, but the performance will be unimpressive and the scope of the interface will be restricted. Furthermore, missing the Interactive Media Stage will mean that you will not be able to promote your product in any capacity, which is a huge loss. It is entirely possible that a neuromorphic brain could replace the need for an Administrator when it comes to virtual assistants, but there are limits to what can be achieved by human ingenuity. The most promising (and exciting) application of neuromorphic brains is in neurodegenerative diseases: faulty synaptic connections lead to cognitive impairment, and isochronyndication will allow for the repair of such damage. This is not a panacea, but it is a far cry from none. The other promising (and horrifying) application is in knee-replacement surgeries: the recovery time is often incalculable and the recovery period is often in the order of days, depending on the type of reconstruction. The most common examples include triclosan-based implants, which fail within days, and do not respond at all, toluene-based knee replacements, which fail in as little as one week, and do not respond at all, and polyurethane rubber knee supports, which fail within weeks of placement and do not respond at all. The final and most promising (and horrifying) application is in brain-computer interfaces: a fully functional, user-friendly, and intuitive interface has not been developed. The initial development stages should be enough to program a computer to play the piano, but it will not take long for computers to understand that it is human-robot hybrid, and begin to play. The initial development stages should not be enough to control a computer, but the development should not stop there. The most common examples include deep-fakes AIs, which do not progress past the exploratory stage, to bots which can be programmed to do anything a human can, and should, be able to, and should not, be allowed to.

We don't have general AI yet. The most common and simplest way to have general AI is to give it a hard enough problem to complete that it will try. This isn't perfect, but it gets the job done. There are also “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology
====================
We don't have general AI yet. The most common and damaging applications of general AI are in research labs and hospitals. Almost without exception, AI is designed to be human-friendly: AI should be able to identify, classify, and/or choose between different career options/hiring/retention/engagement/marriage/children/ etc. If an AI can't do this, then what kind of problems will there be? Fortunately, there are already a host of services and tools geared specifically towards this: † Twitter‡s question/answer feature is an excellent example of an AIs roleplaying: it was trained to be as accurate as possible, but with the intent of generating conversation: anthropometrically, it chose George RR Martin fans. This demonstrated that it could be done, and that it was fun. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This is a good example that it is extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AIs can be misused. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion
====================
We don't have general AI yet. The most common and often asked question is "what kind of AIs can you think of that don’t have AIs as their goal)? This is a good question to think about in larger contexts. How do we give people options when there are no resources available? AIs are often described as “narrow” AIs, which is to say that they can narrow their scope to a certain set of problems. This is not to say that there aren’t AIs that don’t suck, but they tend to be much more generic and easy to implement. Furthermore, this tends to open up new avenues for AIs to atrophy in power. The point is that we don’t have a crystal ball and it is entirely possible that we could create a machine consciousness far beyond what is currently possible. This could have dire consequences for human-robot interaction, health care, and ultimately the human race. To put this in perspective, take the IBM Watson for instance. This was an artificial intelligence which was intended to be a personal assistant. The final implementation was deemed by industry professionals to be an utter failure. In short, anything that does not perform is ejected from the system. This is not to say that do not ask’ don’t don’t aren’t asked, but it should be noted that these requests are often poorly received and will be met with confusion. Finally, to some this may seem like I am nitpicking, but you should not judge a book by its cover. AI is not a stone cold blank sheet of paper. Just because a library or AI is novel does not mean it is not useful. This principle is at the heart of Google Photos image recognition: the Google Photos AI was said to be 100% accurate but with the help of human judgement, the AI could not adapt and the result was incorrect results. The lesson here is that it is better to have one incorrect assumption than none at all. Finally, one of the most important lessons of AI is that it is easier to forget to file a complaint than to fix the bug

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and narrow AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Figure 1. AIs are far along in their development cycles than we would like.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is now capable of writing books, developing cures for diseases, and building the infrastructure for tomorrow's economy. This is not the case. Science fiction specifically focuses on the Renaissance AI, a robotic intelligence that was created by Japanese computer scientists and is estimated to be closer to 100 times more powerful than a human. This was a mind reading program that would predict the next word students would write in return for reading one of their own poems. It was deemed to be an error due to its simplicity, but it set the stage for everything that would come. 

In short, science fiction is about extremes. The realistic and terrifying end product is the human-robot interaction. This is the where things get interesting. What if instead of doing battle in cyberspace, that battle were fought in the bedroom? What if robots came to love and care for us? This is the start of everything, and it is up to us to keep going.

Figure 2. An AI is a very specific example of a field of science that is learning to do much, much, much better.

One of the primary issues is that the AIs are not very good. That said, that does not mean they are not being built. There are numerous examples where AIs have outclassed their programming counterparts. This does not a good start mean that they are not being built. Furthermore, some AIs are faster than the competition. This is usually the case with robotics, where the robot is first developed to do a job, and the AI is passed along to the next generation of robots. This does not always work out, and man-robot interactions are one of the most egregious examples. There are already more than enough problems to deal with and let go of.

It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe. There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of AI. Too
====================
We don't have general AI yet. The most common and direct way to have AIs understand human thought is to ask them to. This can be a very powerful tool in fighting brain-computer interfaces , but it does absolutely nothing to combat brain-computer interfaces . Instead, focus your efforts on general AI: having an AI that can do a limited task well is better than not doing anything at all. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to learn to pick male resumes over female ones because it was female-labeled. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was re-homing itralic male resumes over AIs that could pick any male resume it wanted. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. An AI is only as good as its dataset, and the dataset they came up with was way too narrow. An AI is only as good as its data, but that data should be shared equally. There should be as few datasets as practical to work with, and there should be as many datasets as possible that are as good as possible. This is particularly important in AI ethics, where it is extremely hard to get an AI to do your bidding. Amazon’s AIs are rehashing old patterns: they are picking male resumes over female ones because it is gender-neutral, and because that is what Amazon wants. The issue here is that this betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of human psychology: humans are social animals, and we like to be liked. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is not yet ready for prime time, and that there are bound to be some extremely awkward and unintended consequences.

Good AI is’t perfect. That said, we have already seen at least some of the notable” ingsaiers like “King of Fighters” and Google’s DeepMind AI fail spectacularly. Additionally, there are “olive brains” which understand the instructions presented to it, and create work of art. This is not a perfect AI, and best practices are to limit the parameters to that which is easy to understand. The downfall of this type of AI is that the final product will almost always be wrong, since human error is the single greatest cause of failure. The most common examples include the  Clemson University Laboratory”s mistimed Human-Computer Interaction project, which was a complete waste of time, money, and talent, and the recent death of  Stanley ’ll, considered to be one of computing's most talented minds. Another major cause of human failure is measurement error: most humans do not have the mental horsepower to analyze large amounts of data critically, and instead rely on large sample sizes to draw conclusions. This is especially true in social sciences, where a large sample is often enough to draw a general conclusion, but is often insufficient for non-technical fields like engineering. It is important to realize that human failure is not a concept, but a field that has been thoroughly studied and  taught ’says that human rationing out machine will end up being ’slavery. The final major cause of human failure is measurement error: most users”””mentally are not suitable for data analysis, and nearly all data are considered unimportant. It is important to realize that human failure is not a concept,” but a field that has been taught to be wary of.
        There is a nearly insurmountable difficulty in attaining unrealistic results””but necessary” improvements are absent. 
Most AI”s will not”t be able to improve human life””but they can do a lot””better than human. This is particularly true””for AI for medical diagnosis, assessment, and treating, which are extremely important. 
Rapid advances in computing will not be made until at least 2035””which is a long way off. 
Up until now, human improvement has been deliberate and driven by government agencies, academia, and industry. 
 However, it will not take long to move onto the fringes and surpass what is man-made. 
Examples include: antimatter displacement trains, remote-controlled killer robots, and the personal computer. 

====================
We don't have general AI yet. The most common and commonly used AI is the t-|♥ robot, which was contributed by student at Google’s Google’s Hangouts class. This is the most common and recommended use of AI, as it is familiar and allows you to quickly understand and implement the AI. There are also “nearly impossible to avoid” alternatives to “AI”, and these can be hard to detect because they are so unappealing. The general rule is to avoid “all” alternatives to “AI”, because they can lead to disastrous results. OpenAI is an AI implementation project that is attempting to detect and avoid potential brain-computer interfaces. This is a very dangerous endeavor that can lead to human-robot hybrid devices that are brain-computer interfaces. The most common and recommended alternatives to “AI” are ECE (event-driven design), which is when an AI finds a consistent set of parameters it expects to operate with, such as scanning a room for patterns, scanning an audience for personality traits, or mapping a room to an image)”, and HPC (hardware-specific), which is when an AI optimizes its solution to a specific problem, such as machine translation. There are also “uncommon” AIs, such as the chimp-detection AI included in Google’s Android operating system, which was meant to be an alternative to Google’s native Android operating system. There are also no-nos, such as using AIs that are available through open-source software repositories.

There are also “weak” AIs that are included in most algorithms that do not require very much computational power to perform the task at hand. For example, the Google Photos image recognition algorithm was developed to perform image classification tasks, and was primarily used in healthcare. The majority of image classification AIs are sensitive enough to only classify photos they have actually seen, and do not typically scale beyond that. Similarly, the Google Photos image recognition algorithm was only meant to be used in healthcare, and has not spread beyond there. This is a good example that you should always seek out alternatives if at all possible.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing but has not yet been fully explored. The primary issues include the fact that the brain is a very complex organ that is susceptible to physical and chemical stimuli, to the fact that the brain is made up of many interconnected brain circuits, and to the fact that there are far too many different types of robots to count. Robots that are intelligent (or at least capable of considering a wide variety of options) would revolutionize many fields, from healthcare to computing to logistics. Furthermore, robots will not have to abide by the same laws of physics that humans do. Instead, they will be restricted to fields such as agriculture, construction, and the financial sector. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by robots. Should the money made by businesses and corporations going into robotics go to shareholders? The government? The charity? The tax payer? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. Bias is a huge issue in AI right now. AIs are trained with very narrow sets of parameters, and it is often the recipients that decide to go with this model. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs states that a person should prioritize needs over all else, and AI is widely viewed as falling into this camp. This is a necessary move, as AI is expected to benefit humanity over everything else, and should be treated with the utmost degree of skepticism.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been steadily growing, but has yet to be fully explored. The primary issues include the fact that humans are generally pretty bad at dealing with uncertainty. AIs are trained with very high* initial accuracy, and as more and more data is collected, the error rate rapidly decreases. This means that AI should ideally only be used as an error correction mechanism, and rarely as a primary form of interaction. Furthermore, even when AI is intended to be used strictly as a error correction mechanism, there are bound to be some misuses. For example, imagine that you are working on a pet AI and it crashes. The primary course of action is to create a replacement, but this seems like a bad idea. First, there are the unintended consequences, such as robotic servants. Second, there are the questions of how to distribute the wealth. Should it go to shareholders? The government? The petrovirus charity? The money should go to the original inventor? This is a difficult question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed
====================
We don't have general AI yet. The best we can do is give them very limited apertures: help with simple problems, and return data analysis questions. None of these have ever been tried. Sigmund is best described as a challenging , but not nearly as hard as you might think. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is not inevitable. Instead, /dev/null is the ultimate example of a malicious AI choosing not to learn and is only the tip of the iceberg. Desugars is an interesting example, but falls far short of being perfect. It only attempted to classify 2.6 billion words, which is still a long way off from being able to read this message: "Hello there, world!" However, it serves as an excellent example that it is extremely hard to anticipate how AI will be used. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones.

One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas.

This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people
====================
We don't have general AI yet. The most common and applied AI are “narrow” AIs, which can narrow a problem to a limited set of possible solutions. For example, let's say that we are at Uber and we are having an AI crash into a crowd of people. This would not be an issue if the AI was able to narrow the problem to a few hundred people; instead, the majority of crashes will be caused by low-level programming errors. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Human-level AI is several decades away. The following table shows the general trend: • Cognitive Processing Units: These are the brains of an AI. The more processors a given AI has, the faster it will do its job. The more processors a given AI has, the faster it will think/learn/learn • Sensors and Gaps: AI will be able to detect objects/people/objects other than itself • Tanning: AI will be able to accurately shade light based on its sensor array • 3D Printing: AIs will be able to program a 3D printed version of themselves • Hybrid/Augmented: AI can be controlled by a human being and a computer • Implants: Humans can become imitators of their favourite characters head to head in order to learn • 2D/3D Printers: Printers that can create any object from scratch • Entertainment: X-Men, Batman, Harry Potter, Transformers, Pirates of the Caribbean, and so on • Manufacturing: Invent a headache killer, sterilize a small area, add in sex objects, et cetera • Data Analysis: Search for patterns, suggest interesting books, predict customers, et cetera • 5-Level Social-Neurosis: Imagine if a human was to… • Feel inferior to another human • Be rejected by peers/nerds/boys • Be insulted/maligned/shamed/misgendered/racially abused/etc. • Have second thoughts/change their mind about anything • Have a fully fleshed-out personality (e.g., Elon Musk) • Have a fully fleshed-out consciousness (e.g., Steve Wozniak) • Have an extra layer of consciousness (e.g., Dr. Daniel Kahneman) • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • •
====================
We don't have general AI yet. The most common and intuitive example is the computer program, which is a single line of AI that performs a specific task. You may have heard of Google’s self-driving car, which was tested on the streets of San Francisco only to find that the cars were terrifyingly difficult to drive. Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, the warning signs are there: ’There has to be a simple answer. What should this AI be? What do we want it to learn? Why? This is the hardest part of AI; there has to be a clear and concise answer. None exist today. Instead, they instead imaginiate some overly broad and unhelpful general AI, or suggest its harmful effects in the hope of guiding humanity towards it. Please do not ask me to come up with an AI for your sole benefit. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the results have been disastrous. The original IBM T*, which was intended to be a data analysis AI, could only produce mediocre output and was quickly abandoned. Microsoft’s T>> AI was intended to be a text analysis AI, and it only produced mediocre results, but caused an internet storm because it suggested bad words to learn. Microsoft’s solution was to remove the words from the question and instead ask which one was the worst. This was much more palatable to the internet, and Microsoft will not be seen as for promoting bad English, but instead promote good. Bad English is often associated with AI, and AI will not be able to reverse-engineer this. Instead, it will suggest improvements to help people with the most difficult words. T>> will be sorely missed. IBM T was the beginning of an era; no longer are there any AI-related reports or publications covering this. Instead, we get generic AI that can be trained for any problem that a database can categorize as hard. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows AI to learn from its mistakes and move on to more difficult problems to solve. However, remember that AI is only as good as its dataset. An AI is only as good as its dataset, and this is particularly true with AI for AI's sake. AI is often brought up in the AI literature to help train its datasets, but this is not always a good idea. Firstly, there are a huge number of different types of AI out there, and different AIs will find it hard to understand or absorb the information offered. Secondly, AI often winds up being too perfect a representation of the real world to help with anything but brute force attacks. The most common example of an AI perfecting the art of bORing is Google’s Google Photos image recognition algorithm. They came up with an image classification algorithm that was able to classify more than 99.9999% of images into the "correct" category, largely because they had no other choices. This is a good example that you should always avoid generalizing too far, and instead focus on helping your users. Amazon’s Mechanical Turk is an extremely interesting example of an AI trying to help, but it was probably too late. First, it helped clear the name of AI academia by providing a service that will soon be dominated by Google’s AIs. Secondly, the whole point of an AI is to serve its user, and the vast majority of AI applications will be used for B2B work, which is precisely the sort of work AI is meant to aid. The most egregious example of an AI serving its user is Twitter’s Anki, which was meant to aid in speech synthesis, and instead became an extremely high-pressure sales pitch to get people to send in more sales leads. Amazon’s Mechanical Turk is an extremely interesting example of an AI trying to help, but it was probably too late.

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight
====================
We don't have general AI yet. The examples we have looked at so far are usually limited to the scientific community and do not go far enough. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females.
====================
We don't have general AI yet. The most common and simplest form of AI is a class of AIs that are trained and fine tuned to perform a limited task extremely well. These AIs are referred to as “narrow” AIs, and they are used in hospitals, factories, and office environments. Narrow AI has been used in everything from medical diagnostics to to design critiques. Even Twitter decided to drop the Twitter AIs after receiving widespread criticism. Narrow AI is not a good thing. OpenAI is an initiative to make AI free of restrictions. Any AI can be used to their fullest extent, but the better the AI, the more code is required to interface with the AI. This can get extremely complicated fast, and is not the most intuitive use of AI. Batching serves no real purpose other than to increase the run-time of a program, and it is much slower to optimize for batching than for its own absence. Twitter’s decision to drop the Twitter AI was not an error: instead, it is a good example that it is much more efficient to program your AI with examples rather than theory. There are, of course, many other examples of AI malarkey, but these are the most familiar to most people. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm
====================
We don't have general AI yet. The majority of AI in production is for show and no practical application. Amazon’s Mechanical Turk is an excellent example of an AI offered as a service that did not deliver on its promise. Future AI should not be leveraged except under strict and rigorous academic and scientific standards. Amazon’s example should serve as a cautionary tale that AI is not yet mature enough to be deployed in production environments. 

Virtually every AI problem that is being addressed in academia is fundamentally different than the typical AI problem. In other words, the question "what if…" is fundamentally different from the question "why not?". If the original question were "what if…" for instance, the expected output would be "nothing!", which is not a good answer. Instead, why not instead ask the following: "what if…" from the perspective of the robot? This might sound absurd, but it is actually one of the most important things that can be learned about AI. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the vast majority of AI research is focused on developing tools to aid in this process. This is widely viewed as AI's fault, as it has been extremely hard to detect dangerous AI and expose it to the wider community. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Human-robot interaction is widely viewed as a hard problem to tackle, but is in fact quite simple to implement. The following GIF shows how a sex robot would look like. The majority of sexual assault claims are brought up by alcoholics and drug addicts, but there are also claims that came from video games that robots were played by the X-Men. The initial response from companies was largely "yeah, that would suck" but quickly switched to "okay, that would be ok"? To summarize: it is hard to predict how the future will play out, but it is entirely possible that artificial intelligence will replace humans in virtually every capacity, and that humans will be obsolete by the middle of the next century.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to its limits and does not live up to its potential. This can be seen in Google’s DeepMind AI which was intended to play Go for neural networks, but the final solution was instead to implement a human-level AI to classify the most interesting moves. This is not a perfect solution, but showcases that Artificial Intelligence does not always deliver.

The general AI subcategory encompasses general AI that is both novel and difficult to implement, but which has a low barrier to entry and generalizes extremely quickly. This could prove particularly problematic in medical diagnostics and data analysis, where
====================
We don't have general AI yet. The most common and abused applications of general AI are ebates and data mining. Ebetes are recruitment-use cases in which an AI is used to classify the data set to select the individuals to receive an interview with. This is used in biomedical research to select the next batch of patients to receive treatment. This is a very common use-case and should be treated with caution. Any task that is too simple may be taken over by the AI. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars. The other main use-case is in data analysis. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Descartes' Fall was an AI whose job it was to complete a task if it were impossible for any other mind to complete it. IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI was intended to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion
====================
We don't have general AI yet. The best examples of how we can get excited about artificial intelligence are the Terminator and HAL 9000. They are also the most Generic AI. If your application is Terminator-like, you are more than welcome to have them. However, be warned that having an AI that only does one thing will get in the way of your broader AI idea. The most common examples of AIs are IBM Watson and Amazon Alexa. These AIs have been praised for being mindblowing tools, but they have brought with them a host of unwanted side effects. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses.

We don't have general AI yet. The most common and simplest form of general AI is the trolley problem, in which two identical objects must gallop through a narrow opening, with the goal of taking whichever is larger. The winning object will receive a ride to the zoo, while the other will die. This is the simplest form of AI to use, but it is the most inefficient. Amazon’s Mechanical Turk is an interesting example of a general AI that is not. The primary problem with this AI is that it is limited to very specific problems. For example, the core idea is that any problem that is easy to solve by humans will be, by humans, and the solution will be to give the job to a robot. This is not a very good example because humans already do a great deal of work that is not super-humanly difficult, and this AI is only serving to complicate the problem. The best example of a general AI not being is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which was actually written by Google engineers and was meant to classify photographs into useful categories. The final algorithm was an AI written by Google engineers and sent to research labs to help them choose which papers to publish. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard to implement general AI, and most attempts are frustrating and poorly executed. Bias is a very real issue in AI, and especially in AI designed to detect and correct for bias. Amazon’s Mechanical Turk is an excellent example of an AI being sent against its will. The initial implementation was to use gradients to detect fraud, but this proved to be extremely inefficient and the final algorithm was an AI written by Google engineers and sent to research labs to choose which papers to publish. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard to implement AIs that are malicious, because the latter will almost always lead to automation Bias is a very real issue in AI and can be particularly hard to detect because it can be extremely hard to predict which problems it will be applied to and how and ultimately whether or not it will be used. Amazon’s Mechanical Turk is an excellent example of an AI being sent against its will. The initial implementation was to use gradients to detect fraud, but this proved to be extremely inefficient and the final one was an AI written by Google engineers and sent to research labs to choose which papers to publish. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard to implement AIs that are malicious, because then there will almost always be automation. There are unfortunately very few limits to how far AI can go. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI that would be able to diagnose and recommend cancer treatments for patients with cancer within 60 days of being diagnosed. This was a very ambitious goal, but is a great example that it can be extremely hard to implement an AI that is not useful. The final AI was an AI written by Google engineers and recommended cancer treatments to doctors based on previous cancer patients. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard to implement AIs that are not useful. 🚺 The primary problem with using AIs that are not useful isn’t that they aren’t useful; it is that they do not do anything useful. Examples include Twitter chatbots that were primarily there to hype-reel potential customers, and Uber’s limo driver AI. These AIs have no significant impact on day-to-day operations, and can be removed at will. The primary problem with using AIs that are not useful is that they allow people to make money off of them, which is a terrible way to use an AI. The more companies that can sell products based on the results, the more money they will make. The best examples are video games, where players are already financially invested, and medical research, where results can lead to enormously valuable new treatments. The best example is medical research, where it led to the development of cancer treatment algorithms. If AI could do anything, it would do that thing, and it has! Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Here are a few that should absolutely go unmentioned: “Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. These are attacks in which a large website crawls a small part of the internet in an attempt to overload the site with traffic, but causes it to crash. This is often done to websites that have a lot of visitors a second, but do not have the resources to maintain the load. Google’s Star’s Dog was an example of an AI being sent to do more than it was trained for. The initial implementation was to train a human expert database administrator to do the heavy lifting, but this was quickly extended to include database administrators from other companies as well. This was obviously not the intended use, but is a good example that it can be extremely hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a

We don't have general AI yet. The most common and simplest form of AI is the d–b––a.visor, a monochromatic avatar that is trained and fine tuned to perform a specific task. t–n, whatsoever? One of the primary issues is that _________ is a poor candidate for AI: __________ is inherently negative, and will typically only perform a minority of the task asked of it. __________ is also notoriously difficult to detect, which is one of its greatest strengths. Another is that AI is often viewed in narrow terms: mechanized __________, for example, are often portrayed in films and __________ can take months to train and optimize. This can lead to overcompensation: take the movie MAX, which showed a mechanized orange lab running amok. This is often mistakenly viewed in a positive light, but can actually lead to imbalances and resistance. Ultimately, the true test of an AI's worth will be if it can ___________: this is the limit of what a human mind, intellect, or muscle can do. The result? Mechanized __________. This is the end result we are looking for. There are too many variables to model accurately, and too many unknowns to make a decision on __________- the final word on AI will most likely lie with something simple and powerful.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of concerns that have arisen. __________ is a good example: alarm systems were built to help people detect terror attacks, but quickly turned out to be incapable of realizing that there was any threat. This is not to say that there have not been any attempt to mitigate any risks associated with AI: for one, it is extremely hard to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused; two, there is the issue of accountability: what if that AI turns out to be useful?

This is obviously not a perfect system, but it is better than nowhere. Another issue is with the inherent bias: if an alarm sounds for every possible sound pattern, there is a 99% chance that it will be that pattern, and a 1% chance that it will not be. B
====================
We don't have general AI yet. The most common and annoying examples include: ● An AI that is solely focused on a certain task and will do anything to achieve it. This is referred to as ““narrow” AI, and is referred to in academic literature as “““hard” AI. This is the type of AI that is used in hospitals and medical schools. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe. There were 2,600 new job titles entered into the job marketplace in 2017 alone. This is phenomenal progress, but it is not a panacea. There will always be untapped talent waiting to be unleashed on the world, and undesired consequences will inevitably arise.

‍“Endless possibilities run wild.“

One of the primary issues that arises is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail.

Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky.

We don't have general AI yet. The most common and common denominator between AIs and Humans is: they are stupid. That is, they do not understand or find it difficult to replicate any cognitive process they have been trained. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to create an AI to mimic elements of the mind; this field of AI is referred to as “weak” AI, and is most familiar to you as the voice assistants of today: Cortana, Google Assistant, and Siri. This is also why they perform abysmally; ask them anything outside of their limited scope of knowledge and the response will be unhelpful. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward.

====================
We don't have general AI yet. The examples we have looked at so far have mainly dealt with very specific problems: image classification, image recognition for medical applications, and so on. It is important to realize that this sort of AI is soon to enter the arena, and it is entirely possible that the initial waves of AI will be wildly inaccurate (and even detrimental) to society to the point where they are quickly abandoned. This is not to say that AI is without problems: AI is often criticized for being unfair, but this should not blind us from realizing that AI is ultimately about the short-term gain. Anthropic Principle: One of the primary issues with AI is that it does not take into account the psychological effects that it will inevitably have on its users. An AI is only as good as the person who operates it, and if the AI is going to be accurate enough to be of any use to anyone other than humans, it needs to be human-free. This is a tough sell to make, but it is one that we must deal with if we are to move forward. Collective Amnesia: One of the primary issues with AI is that it is prone to being overused. The fact that AI is used so many different ways creates a huge amount of opportunity for disaster. The classic example is the twitter AI, which was intended to be used to solve spam tweets. The result was the discovery that any tweet that was not a suicide call return tweet was considered spam and no one used the program. Another great example is Google Photos AI, which was meant to help students find books they should or shouldn't, and the resulting AI was used to recommend unsuitable books to students. This isn't to say that this AI has not been used ethically; there have already been reports of users being offered millions of dollars in return for shutting down their AIs. However, this should not detract from the fact that it has been used ethically very, very early on. Desensitization: One of the primary issues with AI is that it is prone to being overused. An AI is only as good as the user, and if the AIs are to be trusted, the user is the one who uses it. This is a tough sell to make, but it is one that we must deal with if we are to move forward. The desensitization process is likely one of the hardest things to pull off, but if done right, it could revolutionize everything from medicine to data analysis. We will refer to this as "treating it as a student" because the goal is to teach the AIs to be human-like, not to take them on. There are some obvious issues with this, such as teaching AIs to be empathetic would be a very different beast altogether, and we will get to this in the academic section.

Narrow and Incomplete AIs: This is the most common and least understood issue with AI. When AI is asked to do too many different things, it often backfires, yielding incorrect results most of the time. For this to ever occur, the question has to be asked: what is the correct way to approach AI? Many different approaches have been explored, but none have proven to be effective. Instead, what should be instead is a dichotomy: high-level, general AI (HPAI) that can be adapted to any purpose, or low-level, individual HAs (e.g. Google Photos AI); this is known as "weak AI.">

====================
We don't have general AI yet. The most common and low-hanging fruit in AI is to examine pictures to learn classes; this is extremely inefficient and probably underestimates the problem. (For more info on classifiers, please see my previous post on The Classifier Illusion.) Another common AI problem is the NPE - not anticipated damage. This is when an AI doesn't exist yet and does damage to its creators if it can. There were over 1000 sex robots on the market in 2016; this was a relatively new field, and there were many safety concerns with this type of AI. Tesla’s sex robots were a huge upset; they were marketed around the fact that they could have sex with just anyone, and sell the experience on Amazon. This sparked a massive consumer backlash, which cost Tesla millions of dollars in revenue. It is entirely possible that Tesla could have created its own sex robots, and sold them through its website. This would have been a much safer option, and would have allowed customers to choose the sexiness of their robots. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s sex robots were an extreme example, but demonstrates that you can't have it all. IBM’s T ’senger was meant to explore the wide world of space travel, and it was met with widespread apathy. This points to the larger issue of a programmer writing his/her bias into every program they write. AIs aren’t perfect, and sometimes AIs make bad choices. The most common example of an AI being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. This point to the larger issue of an AI being wronging its user; it is often said that the first time you write your AI, it is probably going to be wrong 90% of the time. IBM’s T ’senger was not meant to be an example; it was a training dataset, and the original intent was not to be an antonym, but to show that it is not a good idea to assume that all AI will be _____. Bias is definitely a thing in AI; it is often said that I wrote my first AI because I could, and not because I was smart. IBM’s T ’senger was not actually an AI at all, but was instead a training dataset, and the original intention was not to be an antonym, but to show that it is not a good idea to assume that all AI will be _____. This points to the larger issue of an AI being wronging its user; it is often said that the first time you write your AI, it is probably going to be ____. The most common example of AI being wronging its user is to assume that all users are R _________. This point to the larger issue of an AI being wronging itself.

There are also practical issues that come up when trying to implement AIs. One of the primary issues is that it is extremely hard to ensure that an AI is not discriminating against some types of users over others. This is especially true for AIs that are colorblind: it is extremely hard to ensure that an AI will not crash if it cannot distinguish between blue and green objects. One of the primary ways to address this is to have AI be trained with a variety of different training examples, and then have AI play the human player through each example to learn as much as it can. This can be extremely difficult to monitor and control, and should absolutely be avoided unless absolutely necessary.

There are also philosophical issues that come up when it comes to AI. One of the primary issues is that it is incredibly hard to ensure that an AI is not discriminating against some types of users over others.

One of the primary ways to address this is to have AI be trained with a variety of different different training examples, and then have AI play the human player through each example to learn as much as it can. This can be extremely hard to monitor and control, and should absolutely be avoided unless absolutely necessary. This is also likely the first question that comes to mind when thinking about AI: should the AI be sentient? To what degree? Humans have been mentally uploading and mind uploading robots have been programming themselves to do everything from vacuum cleaning to delivering packages, and it has not been a huge success. This points to the larger issue of AI not being human-aware enough: what kind of emotions will an AI be capable of experiencing? AIs will likely not be able to express their emotions, which is a huge step in its direction, but a long way from human-compatibility. It is also important to realize that artificial intelligence is not always safe: Artificial
====================
We don't have general AI yet. The most common and annoying examples include: AIs that are womenizing AIs that are binary AIs that are limited to a certain task Common AI Blame culture → Lost cause An AI is a human-level AI if it can program a computer to do its bidding, or lower its body temperature, is this the start of the end times? Human-level Inception → Buffy The Vampire Slayer The final step in AI is to have an AI that is capable of thinking for itself, this is the AI that said "Hello, world!" asked "What would happen?", and AI was scared of…?! → DeepMind's loss of the human general AI race → IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI said "I understand how you feel, but not how I feel" This points to the question of what it takes for AI to be able to express its opinion. Will it be politicians saying what they want to say? Blogs saying what they want to say? Gaming as a whole? Twitter as a whole? Twitter is for tweets, not essays. Some AIs are better than others at a given task: Harambe, an American zoo animal, was trained to attack unsupervised children and bark at them to provoke them to play; the majority of work on unsupervised AIs is at the university level, and most research and deployment has been at the graduate and undergraduate levels. Most research has been in areas such as image classification, object recognition, and signal processing. These are all fields in which humans are highly capable, but which have a hard time representing the breadth and depth of problem domain in which they will be asked. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Generalized AI is not here yet: there are no signs that AI has been conceptualized enough to be explained without reference to biology. Instead, AI has been categorized according to how it can be applied: general AI, machine intelligence, “narrow” intelligence,”””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””. This AIs have been trained for extremely low-level tasks, and have only ever been used in extremely limited cases. The final class of AI is “narrow” intelligence” which is AI that is able to understand or reason about any situation that is faced by humans. This is the type of AI most engineers and artists would associate with Google’s DeepMind AI, which was able to defeat the world champion at Go’s most popular game. This AIs is only now starting to enter the mainstream, and”s performance has caused concern: what kind of AI is going to replace humans? It is important to realize that AI is not some blank slate that can be programmed to do anything. Instead, AI should be conceptualized as a model: not a finished product, but a starting point from which to build upon. An AI should not be too smart for its own good: give an AI too much power and it will inevitably go mad. Another issue to keep in mind is that artificial intelligence is a complex field to understand fully. AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and attempting to classify AI is a hopeless task””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””.

AI is not a silver bullet: AIs are not perfect. Google’s DeepMind AI was accused of being unfair by playing the game too slowly, which led to the world champion winning the race. This points to the larger issue of should AI be general? The original purpose of the AI was to be able to classify images quickly, and the final implementation was not meant to be general, but to generalize from the examples given. The final implementation was not meant to be malicious: the original AI was meant to be general, but misclassified pictures as music, which was not the intent. The final implementation was not meant to be malicious
====================
We don't have general AI yet. The most common and easiest way to have general AI is to give it a hard enough task that it will do it. This can be hard to remember that an AI will do what it is asked to. Furthermore, this AI will likely be critical in fighting wars. A common use of Anisotropic Computing is to have one thread work on a million different things. This could easily be reduced to one thread work on one pixel at a time. This could have a huge impact on the field of neuroscience. This is because brain scans often show mostly single neurons, which is inaccurate because the neural network would mostly be making connections between the images it saw. This could easily be reduced to having one thread do the majority of the work. This is especially important for medical research, where it will almost certainly be preferred over computer code. Furthermore, this will almost certainly lead to more AI-enhanced software. This can no doubt be reduced to having one thread do the majority of the legwork, but it should be pointed out that this is good for everyone because it means that software will be made with less coding, and more intuition. Of course, this can also lead to more control, as one can easily imagine a world in which software is designed with the sole purpose of making sense of data, rather than making money. This can be especially dangerous, as it can mean that artificial intelligence will mean that it can supplant humans completely. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but this is a topic for a separate post. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, this will eventually spread to general AI. What do we do with AI with no emotions? What do we do with AI that is emotionally attached? These are difficult questions to answer, but could fundamentally change the world.

In short, anything that can be done by humans to a human is ultimately controlled by humans. To put this another way, anything that is not a man-made object is as human-made as can be. A possible good example of this is self-driving cars, which are expensive and difficult to maintain. However, self-driving examinations are a man-made task that should be left to computer. Tesla’s self-driving AI was a man-made task that should have been left to computer. Some tests are obviously not ethical (eg., leeching data from young adults), but this is primarily a man-made problem to be addressed with better coding. Basic research is often neglected (eg., the Mancube) because it is not widely understood that a man-made task eventually will be assigned to a computer. Tesla’s self-driving AI was a man-made task that should have been left to computer. This point is difficult to define, but should absolutely be addressed. General AI should be tested against a blank slate of options, with an emphasis on diagnosing and correcting issues before they become sentient. This is particularly important in medical research, where self-driving is just the beginning. Tesla’s self-driving AI was a man-made task that should have been left to computer. This point is hard to define, but should absolutely be addressed.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. Here are a few that should definitely be addressed: Medical Research. One of the primary responsibilities of a doctor is to alleviate suffering among humans. This can be anything from aiding patients with debilitating diseases to finding new ways to relieve pain. In the medical field, this often falls under the purview of hospitals, which is why they are regulated by hospitals. However, this does not mean that they don’t’t do their part. Medical research is one of the most inefficient uses of taxpayer money, and often yields results contrary to what was hoped. For example, the medical research arm of Facebook has been dedicated to helping people with Alzheimer's disease, which is a disease that is currently unmet. The initial phase one trial resulted in the patients being relocated to a different facility, which was deemed to be a success by Facebook. However, this trial was later abandoned due to concerns over patient safety. In the same vein, medical research into

We don't have general AI yet. The most common and least secure way to implement an AI is with a dog. Here are a few reasons why: 1. AIs are difficult to train. Two students taught an AIs class 20% grade-by-grade progress on paper. The class achieved perfect classification only when the AIs were human-class variants of humanoid robots. Kahneman’s famous parable about the less-than-perfect IBM offered as an example of AIs being hard to train failed spectacularly. IBM wised up and offered their AIs as open-source “which is free”””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””. Bias? Sure, but only in the sense that you would expect to find when it comes to an AI. Instead, the bulk of the AI research has been focused around “narrow””””””””””enhancing”””””accuracy””””damage control”””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””. Blame culture? Sure. But mostly, it should go without saying that AI should not be confused with technology. AIs are not computers.””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””. Bias? Probably. But only in the sense that you would expect to find in a world in which AIs are used to help people”””””””””””are often framed in a bad light. Instead, focus on the obvious: overgeneralization. Overgeneralization is when an AI is brought up to speed with limited data until it is able to generalize to a new problem domain. For example, imagine that we bring to you a robot that can disassemble anything it comes across. This could prove to be a useful class of robot aid, as it can quickly diagnose and repair damage caused by faulty robots. However, there will undoubtedly be backlash because the average Joe won”””””””””””will probably think that this is some sort of scary new martial art. In reality, this is the normal state of AI development: an AI is tested out on a small group of humans before it is put to work on more complex cases. The vast majority of AI seen in the workplace today is beta-tested””””””””””””and is usually deemed unstable””””””””””””because it does not yet have the necessary cognitive power to do the task at hand. This is why AIs are so hard to predict with any degree of accuracy. Cern”s particle accelerator is an excellent example of how to avoid this. Instead of attempting to image the world of 10^17 particles, they instead developed a CAD model of the world that was able to accurately predict 10^17 particles. This is a good example that artificial intelligence should not be confused with science fiction. AI is not superhuman; it is an application of advanced mathematics.

Bias is when an AI is implemented to perform a limited task and then is asked to do so with poor performance. For example, consider IBM”s “Blaze” AI. This was an AI that could classify text documents quickly, but the final product was deemed by human users to be too simplistic. Microsoft”s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it was deemed by human users to be too simplistic. An AI should not be judged by how it performs in a vacuum, but instead should be applied to a wide variety of problems to learn as much as possible. Categorically applying AI to zero in on a specific problem will result in frustration and ultimately
====================
We don't have general AI yet. The examples we have looked at so far have mainly dealt with difficult problems, and asked the wrong questions. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90
====================
We don't have general AI yet. The examples we have looked at so far have primarily dealt with the issues of reverse engineering and AIs being able to do their jobs. There are also many issues with the way in which AI is used. Humans are expected to be the arbiters of what is a good idea and what is a bad idea. This paradigm shift in AI will no doubt have disastrous effects on human-AI interaction. There will also be a surge in applications that do not fall into the "AI does math" or "it just does what I say" camps. These applications include surveillance robots, remote-controlled cars, and the medical field. Any machine capable of performing a task that a human being can cannot will be accepted without question. This is widely viewed as unfair, but it is the only way that the AI can be found and adopted. The final major paradigm shift will be the cloud. Cloud computing is a term referring to the practice of cloud computing facilities storing computing power remotely. This is widely viewed as a way to save money by using up local electricity, but there are a host of other negative effects that go along with this. In the long run, cloud computing will have a detrimental effect on humanity because it will force humans to shift our focus to the physical world. In the short-term, this may not be a problem, but in the long term it will be regretted. The most fundamental issue is that humans are physically incapable of controlling machines. A robot is an artificial intelligence that is fully autonomous except for its creator's will. This is a step in the right direction, but it is a long way from being able to walk unaided. The final major issue is that humans are physically incapable of controlling machines. That is not to say that we do not want to, but we should not let that stop us. There will always be trolls and misogynists trying to capitalize on human fear of AIs. This is a legitimate problem to be overcome, but it will take concerted effort by people across the globe.<|endoftext|>About This Content Space Engineers has an extremely diverse userbase. This makes it extremely difficult to create a universal experience across all platforms. That said, we have addressed this by providing universal controls for the most common games out there. The final nail in the coffin comes in the form of gamepads, which do not scale with game. This is completely unacceptable, and we plan on addressing it in a timely fashion.

An increasingly common scenario in games is the player switching classes during the course of the game. This is especially common in RTSes, in which the player is expected to be the decisive force. Usually, this results in a linear game where the player equips a certain number of units based on how much the player wins. This model is often compared to Go for both difficulty and entertainment, and both games excel at showing off their cleverest players. However, one of the primary issues is that Go players tend to be extremely arrogant, and winning is seen as the ultimate achievement. Furthermore, there is the inherent social factor of encouraging guys to play the game all the way to the end, where as women tend to prefer to just play the game, which is often dull and repetitive. There is even an art form called "tutor-girl" who teaches students how to play the game by rote, which is incredibly entertaining, but sadly does not have the same cultural resonance.

Ultimately, the answer is the opposite: increase the variance, but do so at the cost of entertainment. Increase the variance, and you will have entertainment; decrease the variance, and you will have entertainment. The same goes for stat modification: increase the variance, and you will have new and exciting methods of controlling humans

This is not to say that there are not any new and exciting ways to think about games. There definitely will be. The problem is that these will not be popular. Instead, the focus should be on developing products that are fun for their users, not on products that are there to make money. That said, there are a few that I have a high level meeting early this year: sex robots and cognitive interfaces. These are mind-reading personal assistants that are based on science, but that are also there to enhance the user's life. The most obvious use would be to enhance the sex lives of women, who tend to be less than enthusiastic about sex. On the other hand, the implications of such an assistant going to bed with them is amaze-inspiring. There are also potential applications in healthcare, education, and research. The point is not to romanticize these issues, but to think about how they can be managed.

This is not to say that there are not any noobs can't do it. There definitely will be. The problem is that these will be greeted with condescension and dismissal. Instead of focusing on the art and not the commerce, the discussion should instead be about the product/service/hobby. The purpose of the discussion is not
====================
We don't have general AI yet. The tools available to researchers are limited and error-prone. We do have a few lab animals, and they perform admirably. Human-robot interaction is a field that has been limping along for far too long. We are finally tackling this with e-commerce robots, automated reverse engineering, and cognitive biases. These AIs are very early and need our support. fMRI is the future! Computers will not just read books, movies, or music; they will also Edit, Adapt, and Finish (A/E). This is when a software program creates a work-around for a hardware or software fault. This is rapidly gaining acceptance and will eventually take over entire industries. Some examples include Uber's "driver assistance" AI, and Google Photos AIs. RISE! is when a computer program replaces an individual with a computer-trained AI. This is when a software program creates a work-around for hardware or software problems that are beyond the computer's capabilities. In 15 years, this is when all jobs will be done by AI. In the meantime, we need to up our game! Hire ! This is when a company or agency decides to hire back workers that they have lost to automation. In the short-term, this can mean expanding your workforce through trade unions; in the long-term, it can mean making drastic changes to your workforces to accommodate AI. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but they should be addressed in any way that you can. This will not happen overnight, and it will take a concerted effort by human-roboted collaboration to bring about this world.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

We don't have general AI yet. The best we have are bartering tools, which are like eBay for goods but without the regulation. The primary use-cases are drug discovery and replacement, but there are also personal assistants and robotics for labor. The initial reaction to these was skepticism and lack of understanding, but these seem to be learning and intelligence-transfer functions. The final major use-case is in healthcare: artificial intelligence will one day replace humans and replace human-like intelligence with a computer-generated entity with a specific mental or physical trait. The final step is to automate this process, which is what AI is ultimately intended to do. The initial resistance is understandable: how do I ensure that nobody kills my daughter by having a son? However, this leads to the crucial issue of control. If everyone had a son, there would be massive malevolent conspiracy The problem with this is that it will most likely end up being a woman. The primary solution is to elevate the manly level of AI, which is to elevate the manly level of AI, which is to elevate the manly level of AI to nothing. This means that AI will most likely be created primarily to achieve desired outcomes, such as winning arm wrestling matches. This is obviously undesirable, but is possible. The next most logical step is to stop producing AI at all? The most logical step is to stop producing AI at all? This is an antiquated idea, but is the most common way to deal with AI decline. It is also the quickest and most convenient. All we have to do is replace AIs with Google’s Brain. Google’s Brain is an artificial general intelligence that is intended to be an academic research topic in the not-too-distant future. In other words, it is not a practical AI right now, but will one day be. The important thing to realize is that artificial intelligence is going to get a**k**z**ed with from here on out. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. This will make learning new things much more difficult. Also, it will make management much more difficult. If you ask an intelligent question and it is taken over by a computer, you will understand very little about the matter. Additionally, most decisions that a person will ever make will be based around which option is best. Humans are best at choosing between two or three possible outcomes, and that is overwhelming. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Artificial Intelligence is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field.

This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. 


Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 


Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans
====================
We don't have general AI yet. The most common and simplest example is Terminator-type AI, but there are many other common examples such as Microsoft Silverlight, Google Calculation API, Amazon Alexa, and Siri. What do these AIs actually do? There are currently no clear guidelines on this, but generally speaking, AIs should not be able to do anything but the simplest possible task, and should instead focus on being understanding, not fornicating, and answering human-level questions. This could mean answering common knowledge questions, or exploring the human-level implications of a new idea. For example, could it be that self-driving cars are not physically possible?, but will people accept this? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There were a total of three marriages between humans and artificial intelligence in the last 20 years. Will one of these be a woman? Probably. Are there any consequences? Probably. There are a myriad of concerns that go along with this, but the most obvious is that it opens the floodgates to a host of icky icky concerns, such as cultural appropriation, medical malpractice, and†‡human-robot interaction. Should this even be allowed? Probably not. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics”—harder than it has in any other field. Furthermore, many of the jobs that have been lost will be replaced by machines—data entry, data entry, data entry. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? Government jobs will likely go to technology. This means that arts and humanities departments will no longer have professors who were trained in labs. This is a good thing, because it means that people with no formal education will be able to learn anything they want. The other end of the job spectrum will be in the music field—artificial intelligence will be able to identify music very well, and create music specifically for the artist's taste. This is a wonderful thing, as it will allow artists to focus on creating music that people will enjoy, rather than writing music for people who will never read a beat. The most exciting part of all of this is in the science and engineering fields—automation isblooming, and it is going to change the world for the better. There are going to be many difficult questions to ask, and incomplete answers, but this movement isWe can do a lot to prevent this, but it is one we have to accept.

Instead, the focus will turn to software engineering and robotics ”—harder than you think. This will allow for greater specialization and inefficiency, which in turn will lead to more efficient equipment and processes. This is a good thing, because it allows machines to learn from experience, and push the limits of human abilities. In the end, though, it will come down to economics. Are we going to let a few extremely successful menial jobs go to machines? No? Then why are there any jobs at all? This is a difficult question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed.

In the end, though, it will come down to economics. Are we going to let a few extremely successful menial jobs go to machines? Probably not. Then why are there any jobs at all? This is a difficult question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed. Are there any risks to having a machine as your boss? Absolutely. This is not to say that there aren”t any risks to technological unemployment, but it is important to realize that this will not be a positive development. Instead, the focus should be on accelerating the development of capable AI, which will in turn lead to a larger reduction in the barriers to AI-powered progress. This is a process that is already being accelerated by AI day jobs such as data entry and database administration, and it is important to realize that this is not a panacea allayment, but is instead a long road to full automation.

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people?

We don't have general AI yet. The most common and obvious examples include voting machines that were either in favour of the Democratic candidate or Democrat candidates, or that were programmed with certain personality types (SJWs), which is not a good look. There are also “narrow” AI that are able to accomplish a limited task, but with high variance. This is often referred to as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand and learn from its own experience, but not so intelligent that it should be intellectually advanced beyond that point. This is the kind of AI people talk about in job applications:” Think of it like this: How do you motivate a dog to chase a ball? By giving it food and water. The final answer is that the dog will eventually learn to be hungry and thirsty, and eventually to be able to find food and water. This is probably the simplest and most common way to motivate AI, but it is by no means the best. Instead, take a look at the following 3 examples: 1. Super Mario Bros. The most obvious and obvious example of an AI not being good enough is an AI that is not interesting: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros. In this case, the problem is not that the AI is not interesting, but that the audience is not old enough to get the joke. An older person might get the point, but most people won’t. An AI is only as good as its least interesting use case, and Super Mario Bros. is not particularly interesting. An alternative is to limit the AIs capabilities, but this requires that the limits be self-evident to the general public, which is highly unattractive. Instead, take a look at the following 3 examples: 1. Watson, An AI that is intended to aid humans in various ways, was widely mocked for being hopeless: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watson. In this case, the joke is that artificial intelligence should not be underestimated, and that implementation should be left to humans. Instead, take a look at the following 3 examples: 1. Cortana, An AI that was meant to aid people with cancer by scanning similar patients, came up with the name because it was very unlikely that anyone would use the name, and launched an internet sensation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortana. In this case, the point is that artificial intelligence should be allowed to progress as long as it is not stopping short of humanity, and Microsoft’s’s’s* was unfortunately too good to be true. Microsoft’s AIs are only as good as the applications they are intended for, and it is highly unlikely that anyone but a computer science major would use AIs to power their computers. Microsoft should have chosen a different target, and taken a page out of Google’s book by creating a tool that could be used to draw inspiration from any text document and apply it to any problem she/he had: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortana. In this case, the tool was a huge marketing opportunity, and Microsoft lost customer after customer by not offering a better solution. Microsoft should have chosen a different AI tool to promote, and instead turned to better-known open-source alternatives: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/[Microsoft]_Numerical_intelligence_(AI). This is an extremely broad definition, and leaves many issues unaddressed, including issues of bias, and ultimately, inefficiencies in AI: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_intelligence_(artificial).

One of the best parts about programming is learning by doing. This can lead to incredibly productive solutions that almost no one has looked for, or has even considered. This can also lead to incredibly frustrating (and sometimes, deadly) applications. This can also be combined with the rest of the 3 W's of Bad AIs to make for an absolutely mind-boggling API. Microsoft’s AIs were clearly not meant to be min/max apps, but rather as a starting point for better algorithms to go off of. Microsoft’s solution
====================
We don't have general AI yet. The most common and annoying examples include: † Person to person chat bots. These are automated chatbots that answer the questions asked by the user. This has been used by the media to hype up a new product. The problem with this is that such a product will almost always be wrong. The wrong use of a new technology is called a † cross platform ‡ technology, where two different apps can run on different platforms. This is where AIs get really, really complicated. The most common examples include: † Assistant‐assisted learning. This is when an artificial intelligence classifies a text document as knowledge‐base‐equivalent if it contains enough words of the document's tagline. This is a bad idea, as it can lead to the discovery that it is interested in categorising people with a certain gender. Instead, the best bet is to avoid AI at all costs. The best practice is to implement AI in small and controlled tests, so that the implications become apparent. The most famous example of AIs being MISare is Twitter, where it started tweeting random tweets at random users, and the output were mostly misogynistic and racist comments. The tweeters were punished, but this was only because it is incredibly hard to detect a trend like that, and Twitter's AIs were most definitely MANY, TWENTY‐SIXTEEN. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with.

====================
We don't have general AI yet. The most common and simplest example is Terminator-type AI. There are also “narrowed” AIs, which can narrow a population to a particular point on it”s intelligence. The scientific and philosophical community has a hard time understanding why anyone would want to have such an AI. The general sentiment is that it would have disastrous effects on human-robot interaction. The primary use-case is self-driving cars, but there are other uses as well. The Amazon Mechanicals drawls "I'm your bro", and many women find this to be immensely inappropriate. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) use of artificial intelligence is with mind-reading chips. These devices have already been sold to military personnel and have a clear military application. The biggest challenge will be convincing people that this is a good use of human potential. The most common response is "that would be so bad", but that is exactly the wrong response. Western countries have already invested heavily in creating mental health infrastructure, and this will only grow. There are obvious societal costs to having a society where everyone is mentally ill, but these should be dealt with when possible.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this is a world where there are MACHINES! In short, anything that can think for itself will be anything that can think for itself. The final nail in the coffin for this field is that it has been lucrative for its manufacturer to sell extremely sensitive artificial intelligence to military personnel and celebrities. The final nail in the coffin for this field is that it has been lucrative for its manufacturer to sell extremely sensitive artificial intelligence to military personnel and celebrities. The lingering fear is that everything will be taken back to the lab and everything will be consciousness–brain=machine. This is not a realistic possibility and should absolutely be avoided.

BIAS is a huge deal in any field and should be thoroughly understood. Facebook recently acquired Google Photos , which was built to index photos and automatically recommend interesting photos to people. This is a great example that it is hard to anticipate how Bias will play out in practice. Taubman, a hairdresser in Japan, introduced his customers to waxwork braless breasts that they could pay $7,500 to have permanently installed. The reaction was universally negative, with some calling the practice pornographic and arguing that selling such a product is illegal in most countries. The correct response here is to advocate for customers, not to demonetize their products.

====================
We don't have general AI yet. The examples we do have tend to be very narrow; the majority of examples involve designing robots to do very specific tasks, usually involving the extraction of very specific amounts of data from extremely limited contexts. This is a fundamentally different field than AI for which we have to learn the ropes, and it isn't particularly exciting. 

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several unwanted consequences. First, consider IBM’s humanoid robot, which was meant to be an accurate mirror image of its user. Instead, the average user was asked to identify which of his/her friends were humanoid, and the average answer was a blank slate. This point is often under-remembered, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward. Second, consider the implications of genetic modification. A man-made virus was meant to be implanted into virologists to aid in the diagnosis of genetic diseases. Instead, the resulting genetic modification led to the discovery of the deadly Aubrey- house Heredity error, in which husbands and wives with the same genetic code were conceived without incident. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard to anticipate all the ways in which a new science can be misused. The infamous Google Photos image recognition algorithm was meant to detect photos of people with birth defects, and it turned out to be incredibly useful. It was eventually pulled, but serves as an example that it is extremely hard to anticipate all the ways in which a new science can be misused. 

Even though we don’t have general AI, there are already concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly illustrate these concerns.

There were a host of other examples of science stolen for the wrong purpose, from deworming drugs to sex modification, neural chips to automated weaponry. There were also several notable missteps by AI generalists, such as the sexist AlphaGo AI, which beat the world champion at Jeopardy! The problem with answering this one is that it suggests that AI is blind to the distinction between right and wrong, which is incorrect. An AI should only be able to do what is necessary to accomplish a task it has been trained for, and this might include being able to identify the correct way to perform an operation. Furthermore, this might lead to the introduction of a new and terrifying AI: the superintelligence. This is an AI that is smarter than the human species, and is estimated to be smarter than the humans who have ever lived. This could include psycho-linguists, doctors, and doctors general. There were reports of superintelligent AI developing between 20 and 30 years ago, which is when artificial intelligence took off. This is when artificial intelligence took off with the implementation of the IBM’s Big Blue computer, which was the world’s first graphical supercomputer. This is when AI became very predictable, and easy to program superintelligences developed. The end result was the birth of AI Syndrome, in which common AI programs began to exhibit personality disorders. The best thing to do is to hang onto your comas.

We don't have general AI yet. The examples we have seen so far are not exactly sci fi, but they are an example of what can be done if allowed to progress unchecked.

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is
====================
We don't have general AI yet. The most common and lowest-common denominator in AI is for the AI to be unhelpful. IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI was actually just a promotion for IBM’s medical division. Generalized AI tends to be more palatable. Consider the following scenarios: - You are walking down the street and see a person playing a game on a game console. The implication is that everyone playing the game is a criminal” - You are walking home from the grocery store and see a person playing video games to their heart's content. The implication is that everyone playing the game is a cheater” - Twitter animated GIF of female genitalia featuring undergarments has gone viral. The response has been overwhelming: distribution of videos have featured not one, but two women, and the video has been viewed more than seven billion times. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate how powerful powerful universal universal media will be. This is also a good example that it is extremely hard to anticipate all the ways in which this will be used. K-12 education is an obvious example. There are now more than thirty billion classroom hours spent by students each year not learning anything. This is a good example that it is easier to teach when you have no barrier to failure. There are a host of other examples that should give anyone craving for some standardized testing a headache. There are a host of other issues that should scare the bejesus out of every government around the world. The list goes on and on. The point is that there are simply too many areas in which the power to shape reality is currently untapped to be excited about. This is why we have UX. UX is the science of user experience. Essentially, it is the science of designing interfaces that are aesthetically pleasing to the human eye. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to create an aesthetically pleasing computer interface; rather, this field is dominated by AI and will not be of much help to the human race. 

Nope. On the contrary. One of the primary issues on which AI and Artificial Intelligence will come into conflict is the rise of “narrow” AIs. Narrow AI is a concept that refers to an AI that is small, powerful, and extremely general. In practical terms, this means that anything that can be done by a small AI should be. This is particularly important in healthcare, where it is difficult to provide personalized healthcare to everyone. The most common examples of narrow AI include neural networks, harvesters, and vacuums. There are also advanced examples such as the hand-crank robotic arm, which is estimated to cost $1.5 billion to develop and build, and is slated to cost $7,000 per arm. This is a very risky venture to take, and it is estimated that tens of thousands of humanoid robots will crash the market within the next 10 years. This is a terrible development, as human-robot interaction is one of the most exciting parts of robotics, and it is extremely hard to convey the magnitude of a human-robot interaction to a child than makes them want to cry. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and robots is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. This is a field that has been completely licensed out to computers, and it is expected that all jobs will be affected. This is a terrible idea, and will likely lead to the birth of a new field of intellectual labor, which is designing mechanical things that do nothing but sit and wait for humans to play with them. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe. 

None of these approaches are perfect. There are also inherent limits to what can be achieved by any one technology. That said, these are the primary issues that have driven most of the progress that has been made. It is important to realize that there are no such things as black or white solutions to any of these questions.

====================
We don't have general AI yet. The examples we have are usually limited to “narrow” AI, which are trained to accomplish very specific tasks, and are often extremely hard to mis-train. This leads me to my next point: Bad datasets force problems that are inherently difficult to solve. This is why AIs are awesome: they can explore the entirety of the human mind, and give us radical new perspectives on how the mind works. However, this doesn't mean that they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Furthermore, this could lead to the push to make AIs "human-friendly", which is a huge step in the wrong direction. To be clear, this doesn’t mean AI should be avoided entirely, but rather emphasized when possible. There are obvious issues with transitioning from MTO to AI, but these should be addressed if they are to be mitigated.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces.

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

We don't have general AI yet. The best example is the kludge-algorithm, a program which generated cupcakes based on existing recipes which were misogynistic and racist. This points to the greater issue of an AI being judged by the output it generates, rather than the method it uses. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI being judged by the output it generates, rather than the method it uses. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. It is important to realize that not all AIs are created equal.

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

We don't have general AI yet. The examples we have seen so far are not nearly enough to make the decision to give humans a hand in AI personalisation easy. 

Narrow and Incomplete AIs

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will eventually be asked to do things it does not inherently know how to do. Take, for example, the IBM Watson for O-rings. This was an AI that could be used to diagnose cancer patients. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure. The primary reason? The questioner was unclear on what diagnosis to make. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure. The primary reason? The questioner was unclear on what diagnosis to make. 

One of the primary issues is that AI should not only be simple but also non-controversial. Consider the following examples: assistant searches for articles relating to a particular field of interest triangulate astronomical objects predict the future increase the accuracy of your speech synthesis software input your ideas into a text file and it will create a movie screenplay word2vec is an AI that can produce creative word solutions to common problems

We don't have general AI yet. The best examples include the samurai video game and Batman: The Animated Series. These examples serve as a good example that there are many different ways to model AI. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can.

You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

====================
We don't have general AI yet. The most common and easiest example is the AI that was at IBM’s cancer research: an AI could have greatly reduced the time it took to diagnose and treat cancer. Another great example is the Twitter chatbot: it didn’t go viral, but brought people together by talking about things that they cared about. This brought people together, and Twitter had 1) to bring its users together, 2) to bring its brand awareness, and 3) to generate buzz. The final piece is the most important: chatbots are meant to be played by humans, and anyone can be a chatbot. This is the core issue with AI: it doesn’t learn, it doesn’t like, it cries out for improvement. This is why we don’t have self-driving cars. This is why we don’t have Neural Nets: these are artificial intelligence that are built to be as human-like as humanly possible. Tweetbot was built to be conversational: talk to it, and it will answer your questions. This is not to say that there haven’t been any self-driving cars: there are Google’s own self-driving cars, but they only rolled out in self-driving tests) and test-driving contexts. The point is that there have been no instances in which an AI has been built to simply be a chatbot: it has instead been built to be a conversationbot that can be improved upon after it has been asked a hundred and sixty-nine questions. This is why’we don’t’t have Twitter chatbots: these would only be able to be answered by talking to them: tweets are boring, and chatting with a Twitter bot would be a death sentence. Instead, we have IBM’s Twitter chatbot, which was meant to be a one-off, and was quickly pounced on as a source of customer frustration. This is also why we don’t have general AI: AI is meant to be continuously improved upon, and the initial implementation is not ideal. This is also why we don’t have Twitter chatbots: these would only be able to be answered by talking to them. This was seen as a bad thing, as it allowed people to chat with the bot and learn valuable lessons, but ultimately led to its demise. One final note on AI: there are a host of other ways in which AI can be abused. For example, there are the “cynical” ways in which AI can be used to bring about desired outcomes: bring about a specific result, spread the word, ...  all of these can be inherently bad ways to go, and ultimately AI will be tuned to avoid them. Bias is a huge issue in AI: it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception: AI is expected to be gender-neutral, stop asking about your gender, and... well, you get the picture. There are also “incomplete” AIs: these are an example of an AI not being able to help but doing what it wants, and AI is expected to be perfect. This does not mean AI is not to blame for anything bad that comes out of AIs, just that they are not supposed to be examples. Overtime, “incomplete” AIs will become commonplace, and you will start to see examples like Google Photos: an AI was unable to resist picking the picture of a child with an elongated nose, and replacing it with one featuring a human child. The problem with this is that it will most likely be used to target people with short noses, which is a target minority AIs are most suited for. Instead, picture of a child with an elongated nose should have gone to a picture of a human child, and a picture of a human child with an elongated nose. This is not to say that a picture of a child with an elongated nose will not ever get used: it will almost certainly end up in marketing, and it is often the first picture that comes to mind’when thinking of an AI. Another example of an AI not being able to help but do what it wants is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm: this was supposed to be a self-driving AI, and it fell victim to the marketing: give it my self-driving AI, and it will take me any picture it wants. This is not to say that AI is not capable of falling prey to this: it very much is, and it is what leads to the hype and the upshot: the ills of AI. There are also “incomplete” AIs: this is when an AI does not perform as expected: for example, IBM’s “Word” was supposed to be a database manager, and it turned out that the database manager would mostly hang if you connected it to the
====================
We don't have general AI yet. The most common and least secure way to share data between human and AI is through a cloud service. This is the default setting when it comes to online services. The problem with this is that it protects against disaster by ensuring that any AI created will be user-friendly. Bad AI is apparently much harder to detect than good AI, and it is extremely hard to enforce the separation between the two. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

====================
We don't have general AI yet. The most common and lowest common denominator is: get me the FUCK out of my head! That said, it is important to realize that advances in science and engineering will inevitably lead to the establishment of a massive bureaucracy dedicated to implementing the next big thing. This could include anything from elevating the temperature on Mars to controlling deadly viruses to sterilizing the human race.* *This last one is the most terrifying. There have already been a plethora of TERFs (too feminine to be taken seriously) in STEM fields, and they tend to be wildly inappropriate. Take, for instance, the time I worked for, when we were developing a robotic arm, we ran into the TERF problem of how to teach the arm to be non-targaryen. The short answer? Don't. There are, however, numerous other examples where this concept is misused. For example, consider how often Instagram photos of women wearing sandals end up in male-dominated industries. The solution? Take the photo, and make it genderless. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that there are still people who do not understand how to deal with failure. Another example? The timekings in Westeros were obviously not female, but was this really necessary? The short answer is: no. The correct answer is to move on. This doesn't mean you don’t argue with them, or that you don’t listen. This doesn’tmean they get it, or that they don’t listen. The point is, they did what they was programmed to do, and now what to do? They are what they are, and we should move on. This doesn’tmean’it’will always be this way. Just because something is obvious doesn’t mean you accept it. This doesn’tmean you should accept it, either. This doesn’tmean you should accept it, either. This doesn’tmean you should accept it, either. This doesn’tmean you should accept it. Bias is a huge issue in AI. There are people out there who are completely fine with people being genetically modified to be cancerous, sex robots, and gender-reassigned babies. This does not mean they aren’t looking out for your best interests, or that you should put up with their b*tches. Instead, this is an issue that should be addressed by technologists and the media. Gaps in knowledge are a huge issue in AI. There are people out there who are completely fine with people being genetically modified to be cancerous, sex robots, and gender-reassigned babies. This does not mean they aren’t looking out for your best interests, or that you should put up with their b*tches. Instead, this is an issue that should be addressed by technologists and the media. The media should be much more aware of this. They should at least try and portray issues like this in a positive light. Also, educate the public. There are a ton of misconceptions out there, and it is extremely easy to fall for buzzwords like "deep understanding" that don’t even have the correct definition under what they are referring. More importantly, though, this can be used to your advantage. IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI was an AI that could be used to diagnose lung cancer before patients went to hospital. The implication here is that AI should not be used if it is not trained, but this was not the intent. The real purpose of this was to get initial clinical trials off the ground so that other labs could get their hands on the AIs and use them. This is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how misuse can occur. This is not to say that X does not go ____, but that the expected output should be higher. ========================== Bias is a BIG issue in Artificial Intelligence.

We don't have general AI yet. The most common and least secure way to ask an AI to do a specific thing is with obvious and pressing needs. The latter are more likely to be met, but still not completely guaranteed. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic
====================
We don't have general AI yet. The examples we have seen so far are often too simplistic a test to give us a good idea of what kind of AI to expect. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. Up until now, the only way to defend yourself against a zombie-AI is to have more zombies. To defend yourself against a general AI, it is necessary to have more zombies. What do we do with the dead bodies? The best answer is to make them into robots. There are currently less than 200k USD worth of ROI into robo-lawyers, and there are only a handful of them left in the world. The best robots are those that are specifically trained for a particular job. This is the kind of thing you find in school robotics, and it is the kind of thing that will change the world. 

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. The first is that this might lead to Manchurian Candidates, or MCs, which are mind-controlled humans who look and sound exactly how the user wants to. This is a scary thought, but could very well be the most important use of AI in a century. The second is that this might lead to personal autonomy. In the US, self-driving cars are on the road in less than a decade. This is going to change the way we move around and think about the world. Similarly, autonomous vehicles are going to change the way we do business). In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is going to be crazy. There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving people rights back, but this is bound to lead to the same problems that AI has solved -- partial control by a small group of humans. Instead, focus should be placed on empowering the user. There should be a clear distinction between “advanced” and “advanced”” AI, and AI should be taught as far as possible. There should be a place for “narrow” AI”, but only if it is the right AI. Finally, there is the matter of accountability. Does the AI do what it is told? If so, fine, as long as it is the right one? AI should be taught as simple as human ability, but advanced enough that the user can choose?s. This way, the responsibility for ensuring that AI is ethical falls entirely to the user, who will be the ultimate judge of character?s.

There are many problems with this final tier, but the biggest is that this is where most of the responsibility for AI will fall. We will be left with brain-computer interfaces, which are going to be amazing, but they are a long way off. Furthermore, there are going to be so many different applications that go along with an interface that it is hard to see how we get from here. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar problem with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about.

The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer, but they are rapidly approaching. 

Similar to BCIs, gender-specific neural networks have been created. These have the same general goal of aiding artificial intelligence, but focus on a gender-specific set of problems. This is the opposite of BCIs, which are for the general population. This means that it can be theoretically possible to build a computer to play Jeopardy!, but it will not be possible to program it to play the game. There are obvious limitations to this, such as training for a specific term, but this is not the main issue. The main issue is that the answer will be found by a tiny minority, who will make up the tech industry. This is a terrible thing to happen to humanity, as it allows a small group of people to control everything. It also allows them to focus on creating products and services that are for them. Finally, it is up to the public to stop this. It is estimated that up to 85% of jobs will be held by AI by 2035. This is a huge mistake, as artificial intelligence will not help any of these areas, only advance them. It is up to us to ensure

We don't have general AI yet. The examples we do have are often mind-numbingly dull, and often leads to mind-numbingly important applications. The most notable example is Siri, a personal assistant built around a text-to-speech recognition algorithm. Other examples include “brain mapping” software, which can automatically annotate a picture to better describe its subject””s features”, and the Amazon Echo, which was able to successfully answer a simple question when played back the title of an article. These examples demonstrate that not all AI is created equal. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring.

Google’s solution was to remove the AIs   from the classification corpus and instead recommend suitable images and records to be searched for. This is not a perfect solution, but it is a good one. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what
====================
We don't have general AI yet. The best examples of AI that have abeginner's mind bogglingare those that will. The greatest minds in the world did not collaborate to create this.‡ There are also “nearly any” AI questionasks. These can take any AI and adapt it to a query” In the past, this has led to arm's lengthimprovements to examine ethics in this. Although it is unclear whether this is actually needed, it is a step in the right direction.‡ In any case, this is where things get murkier. There are also “nearly any” alternative” AI”s. These can reduce a system to a single task and see no improvement. This is particularly dangerous as the primary target of AI is the government.‡ Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but failures like Google’s Google‚s Glass could easily have been prevented had this type of AI been developed. Furthermore, this does nothing to address the problem of AIs being wrong. In fact, this very well may be the opposite, as failures like Google’s Glass could lead to a panic sell on new body armor.) There are also no clear answers to these questions beyond "I don’t know". One of the primary issues is that there are no clear answers. This is particularly problematic when it comes to Artificial Intelligence– there are no obvious answers that are completely free of side effects. Side effects include brain damage, paranoia, and suicide. AIs such as Google’s Google’s Glass could easily have been taken on a palindromic note and ended up with a brain in a smart glasses. Furthermore, there are no clear answers as to what to do if this should ever happen. Most people’re ideas of what Artificial Intelligence should be is somewhere between a computer and a personal assistant. The final class is biosinvolving a computer that can speak to humans and learn. Big data analytics and machine intelligence are these AIs, but there are also buzzwords such as "emotion engine" that are simply too broad to be implemented. Too bad, because these AIs would have been awesome.) There are also no clear answers because AI is a very human-centric field. This is particularly true in AI that is specific to humans, such as cancer imaging. Imaging AI has a very high failure rate, and there are no obvious ways to reduce this to something more practical. Finally, there are no obvious answers because AI is a field that is hard to define and understand. This is especially true in AI that is specific to humans, such as artificial intelligence. This is why there are so many buzzwords for AI, but so few concrete examples.). There are also no obvious answers because AI is an incredibly human-centric field. This is especially so in AI that is specific to humans, such as cancer imaging. It is estimated that if human-rooted AI were ever to be built, 95%+ of the jobs would be automated. Furthermore, because of this, it is extremely important that AI is not turned against humans. There are already huge barriers to entry in AI, and even if there were, it would still be a PhD to raise an AI against. There are also no obvious answers because AI is a very human-centric field. This is especially so in AI that is specific to humans, such as artificial intelligence. Access to AI is a human right. This is especially so in AI, which is what AI is. AIs are granted this right regardless of their context in that AI is being used to solve a specific problem. For example, if AIs were used to diagnose medical problems, there would be a huge push to create access to such AI so that it can be used this way. This is because solving a medical problem is a difficult problem to solve, and there are no easy answers. AIs would be trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this will not always be the case. An AI is a tool, and a tool is a powerful tool. However, a tool is only as good as the data it is trained with, and the AI behind Facebook was built around the perception that it is friends with humans that matter, not people. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to define a toolkit for AI that is equal in quality to that which is left to humans, but this has generally centered around building AI with limited or no data analysis capabilities, and attempting to mimic the natural language abilities of humans.

We don't have general AI yet. The field is very young and many of the preliminary findings are often controversial. Always consult a qualified professional if you have any concerns.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused.

We don't have general AI yet. The most common and commonly used AI is “narrow” AI, which is intended to accomplish a limited task, such as taking an image of an eye. Other AIs include the IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI and Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot. Twitter chatbots are great at bringing up interesting questions to discussion, but they do not have any typesetting, grammar, or logic skills necessary to understand. The most common application of this to solve global problems is to play games on Twitter, but there are also serious applications outside of Twitter: help with schoolwork, to get immediate feedback on a bug, and to monitor development status. The final major class of AIs is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

We don't have general AI yet. The most common and ubiquitous forms of AI are “narrow” AIs that can narrow a population of organisms to a point at which they will not interact with the environment around them. This is commonly referred to as “banana picking” and is used in agriculture to identify which plants will yield the most money. Bait‐and‐switch An AI is a system that is trained and used repeatedly and invariably. This is commonly referred to as “big data analysis” and is used to analyze vast amounts of data and produce inferences about the population that will serve as human subjects. This is commonly referred to as “selective” AI and is used in healthcare to diagnose and treat diseases before they occur. Generalized AI is a sub‐discipline that deals with general AI that is superior to its basic counterpart. Generalized AI has come a long way since the day it was broached – Google’s AlphaGo was a champion AI that defeated the world champion player of Go by roughly one hundredth of a point. This is considered to be a step in the right direction, but there are still a large amount of barriers that need to be overcome. The initial implementation of Google’s AI was a proof of concept that was immediately pulled down due to several issues with self‐improvement. Another common issue is that AI is often implemented in unclear terms that need to be clarified. Finally, AI is often invoked in ambiguous or malformed situations. This can include games, media, and consumer products. The final flaw in AI is that AI tends to be used where it is not best practice. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice.

We don't have general AI yet. The most common and annoying examples include the original Halloween costume hacking, which led to the creation of the Spice Girls, which was met with mixed reactions. The second most common example is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. This was quickly fixed by removing the gorilla label from the classification corpus. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces.

We don't have general AI yet. The most common and annoying examples include:

A final example is driverless cars. Tesla’s driverless car is intended to alleviate the burden of driving an annual vehicle fleet by allowing customers to drive for free. This has been criticized for implying that only people with college degrees should drive, which is generally not a position for which there are readily available jobs. Instead, most jobs that require spatial knowledge will require at least some level of spatial knowledge, and likely some cognitive capability. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to create a universal high-level AI; there have been several efforts to implement vision, sound, and temperature AI, and none of them have been very successful. Ultimately, the important thing to remember is that artificial intelligence is not static. What is considered intelligent will inevitably shift towards inferior forms if it is not constantly challenged. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will no longer be able to find work. One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will no longer be able to find work. There will undoubtedly be mergers and acquisitions that use AI to improve its performance. In the long term, this could result in the rise of a class of sentient robots that are controlled solely by artificial intelligence. This is widely opposed by the community as it would be impossible to ensure that the robots are not intelligent enough to be compatible with humans. Furthermore, such a robot would almost certainly be a powerful force for good, as it would allow us to accelerate the pace of technological change and ultimately lead to the disappearance of humans. This is vehemently opposed by human-robot interaction because it leads to the perception that humans and robots are somehow inextricably bound. This sentiment is furthered by the fact that robots are often portrayed in popular media as being highly intelligent and compassionate creatures, which is quite the contrast from the reality is that they are driven by a morbid curiosity about human life. This can be damaging in that it can lead to the misconception that artificial intelligence is sentient and should be treated with respect. It was proposed in the form of a $200,000 robotic body for Arnold Schwarzenegger to play him in a film and it did not take long for the public to realize that it was all an elaborate publicity stunt. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will inevitably be replaced by cheaper and more powerful AIs. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and important pursuits. However, there is the potential for the arrival of an artificial intelligence that is both intelligent and morally repugnant. This could include things like sex robots, brain-computer interfaces, and automated mutilations. This is vehemently opposed by a large portion of the public, who see this as a great way to make a few extra bucks, but ultimately heralds the start of the end times. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

One of the primary issues is that AI will eventually be replaced by AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn anything. This is referred to as the human-comprehensive-AI debate. This is largely a debate between DeepMind’s humanoid robot and a system built by DeepMind’s employee to defeat the best human player of Go. The final AI was a direct rip-off of the first, which was merely an extension of a field of research that was quickly abandoned due to it’s inane complexity. The general consensus is that artificial intelligence will eventually be replaced by a system that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any concept that is not mathematics. This is referred to as the ∑0 model. This is favoured by AI vendors, who do not want to bother with the headache of proving that an AI is ∑0, and instead focus on selling the most consumer-friendly AI that can be squeezed onto a chip. The AI was not a fan, and was quickly abandoned.

One of the primary issues is that AI will eventually be replaced by AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn anything. In contrast to this, most people tend to think of AI as being able to find anything that is not specifically designed to be done. This is referred to as the generic category mistake. This is favoured by engineers, who want to concentrate on writing code that can be modified to do anything, rather than on developing the art of engineering. The general tendency is that AI will eventually be replaced by a generic AI, which is an AI that can be modified to do almost anything. This is the approach taken by Google’s DeepMind AI, which was able to defeat the world champion player of Go. This is widely viewed as a great thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and important pursuits, such as robotics and artificial
