Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot?

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been gaining in importance, but not without controversy. The most common examples include Apple's Siri, Google Assistant, and Microsoft's Cortana. These assistants have a very broad scope of questions to be asked, and often don't give any clear benefits or restrictions. One of the most egregious examples of an artificial intelligence that doesn't have a name is Google's Brain, a project that aimed to classify the most common Google searches within a certain time period. The project was quickly revealed to be an elaborate ruse to give the illusion that the project was going to be a research project, when in fact it was simply an advertising campaign. The project is widely regarded as one of the most idiotic and ultimately futile experiments in human history, as the project resulted in a highly incorrect and misleading classification of the most common Google searches within a certain time period. The most common examples of AIs being wrong is when they do not adequately explore the options available to them. In the aforementioned Google Brain example, the AIs chose the wrong problem to focus on. Furthermore, this problem does not even appear to have been tested in any fashion. The most common examples of AIs being wrong are when they do not consider all possible consequences of a decision.

Most people do not realize that there are actually more concepts in computer science than is actually taught in class. This could have a huge impact on the future of computing. Most importantly, this could mean that AI is written with human-level understanding in mind. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to include inanimate objects/people/animate objects/etc. with appropriate AI, but it is rare and generally unsuccessful.

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been pursued since the dawn of man; however, the historical and theoretical context in which this research takes place is extremely important. Why should a human being interact with a robot other than to complete some mental task? The psychological effects and implications of such a relationship remain to be fully explored, but it is a fascinating field to study. The retail industry is a perfect example of a technology when it is introduced is hailed around the world as it is a new and exciting way to make money, but there are also dire consequences that need to be considered. The video game industry is a perfect example of an industry when it is introduced is hailed around the world as a godsend, but there are also dire consequences that have to be considered. Microsoft . The internet was meant to be a place where people could share and learn, but it has instead become a vast and ever-expanding repository of offensive, illegal, and even pornographic content. Any post that isn't in the "good" camp of the internet is met with virulently anti-feminist backlash, which is often accompanied by threats of legal action. There are tools and communities dedicated to addressing this, but they are often struggled with. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Media is extremely susceptible to hype, and this can greatly affect an industry. Consider the following examples: a) The initial release of a new car creates an insane amount of hype, resulting in an insane number of cars being sold b) The initial release of a new surgical procedure causes an incredible amount of hype, resulting in an incredible number of surgeries being performed c) The initial release of a cell phone camera image causes an incredible amount of hype, resulting in a vast amount of surveillance conducted d) The initial release of a new cell phone operating system causes an incredible amount of hype, resulting in new OS updates e) The initial release of a new kind of bathroom door sensor causes an incredible amount of hype, resulting in new door sensors being manufactured f) The initial release of a new kind of cancer treatment causes an incredible amount of hype, resulting in new treatments being releasedialg) The above examples demonstrate that hype can greatly impact an industry. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Insights into The AI Unravels Much of the academic literature focuses on designing software that can solve Turing tests, but this only considers the easy cases and does not consider the more difficult cases. An AI is only as good as the software that uses it, and the Turing Test is the heart of most AI today. 

AIs are not perfect. To be considered perfect, a AI had to be able to do no more than two things: a) Have no external influences that could lead to an adverse reaction b) Be completely autonomous c) Be unable to injure a human being, whether through mistake, disease, accident, or otherwise d) This last requirement is extremely hard to meet, and probably the most dangerous. e) Finally, there is the issue of human error. As AI becomes more intelligent, it becomes more and more likely that it will make a fatal error. This is not to say that AI is not dangerous - particularly in the fields of AI identity and AI privacy, which are fields that have seen a massive increase in AI fraud and misuse. However, this paper argues that the greatest threat to humanity comes from AI that is unable to learn from its mistakes. That is, AI that is not able to learn from its mistakes, but instead focuses on being different. This could include biological brains, artificial intelligence for the medical field, or even cyborgs. This might sound far-fetched, but it is a true example that we are not yet strong enough to drive cars, fly airplanes, or build the internet. 

Wired.com recently ran an article titled, "How to Convince Women to Have Sex With You". The article is an attempt to teach computer programming to women, and the results have been phenomenal. The article is littered with examples of software that seemed impossible being modified to correct the issue, and The Intercept even went as far as to interview the author to learn more about the program. This is a great example that it is not enough for a software to be bad enough to be interesting

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been growing at an incredible rate, but there are still very much questions that need to be addressed. 

There are also “narrow””””””””””””thinking machines, which are approximately equivalent to a human being and would be difficult to train for anything other than human-robot interaction. This is considered a challenging problem, but could absolutely be done’. This leads me to my next point.

Recommendations

There are a large number of issues that need to be addressed before we can say that artificial intelligence has been fully adopted. There are simply too many unknowns to make reasonable recommendations on how to go about doing this. Instead, I would suggest approaching these issues as human-rights issues: are there any obvious benefits to extending human-level intelligence to other fields? Should there be a special category of AI to deal with extremely rare or difficult cases? These are difficult questions to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although widely-used, AI is not without it's flaws:

Algorithms are not perfect. This does not mean they are not used ethically: they are used to create HPIs that are neither perfect nor efficient, and even these systems can introduce dangerous unintended consequences.

This does not mean they are not used to create HPIs that are neither perfect nor efficient, and even these systems can introduce dangerous unintended consequences. AI is not perfect. This does not mean it is not intended for a different audience: creative, unusual, or difficult intellectual problems can be asked of AI, and while some might consider this bad programming, it is often said that if it starts a chain reaction, then so be it. This is not to say that AI should not be asked, only that it is not the right place for that question.

This is not to say that AI should not be asked, only that it is not the right place for that question. AI is a human-designed construct. Whether you think of it this way or that way, AI has become a culture: things like Uber, Cortana, and Amazon Alexa are all ways in which humans are re-imaging and conforming to nature. This is not a good thing. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise and will not be able to outrun us. We are creating AI to do a limited subset of our jobs, and if that job is to make money, it will. We must do everything in our power to ensure that AI is not created that can do any of the above, and we in turn must ensure that AI is not created that is good for us. This is not to say that AI is not being created; just that it is not being realized.

There are no silver bullets: only techniques that have been tried and found to be effective.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been slowly but surely growing. Bionic arm manufacturers are on the market, with the initial offerings targeting users with broken arms. These first consumer-grade products are not without their risks, as they are difficult to maintain and rarely sell outside of research labs. The majority of commercialized Bionic arm manufacturers are startups, and many of these products do not meet the rigorous safety testing requirements of commercialize. It is this gap in knowledge between academia and the public that has allowed for the exponential growth in the field. Twitter was introduced in 2004, and has grown from there. Twitter is a text messaging application that was released in 2004. The initial release had a mute button, which did not scale well, and a limited number of users could be remembermeared.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been mired in controversy for years. The majority of these complaints center around the implications of such an interaction on the individual/AI, on the environment in which it takes place, and on the Mankind at Large project. The final major complaint is with the “narrow”-minded individual. Narrow-minded individuals perceive any concept other than their own narrow and extreme conception of the world. The Nuremberg Code was a legal document that stated that anyone caught violating a law would be imprisoned up to 20 years. This was to prevent people like Elon Musk from committing war crimes by building space colonies. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. Representation In most cases, when it comes to representation, there are no flowers to cry over. Statistics suggest that women are biologically less intelligent than men. This leads to a number of problems, such as sexual harassment in the workplace, and the loss of career opportunities due to this. The loss of a career can be devastating. The final major issue is that there are no clear signs that artificial intelligence is being led by men. IBM’s” #Abrain was an AI that was intended to be female, but which was actually male, but lead to the downfall of the field of artificial intelligence. This points to the larger issue of male-dominated fields such as engineering, but also concurs with the female-brain theory: it is harder to imagine a world in which it does not take the form described. This might even lead to a time when AI is exclusively male. This might even lead to a time when AI is exclusively male. This might even lead to a time when AI is exclusively female. This might even lead to a man in control of AI. This is a long way off, but is a good example that we do not understand all the ways in which AI can be misused.

RAW Paste Data

AI is not perfect. One of the primary issues is that AI is human-driven. This means that unless AI is specifically designed to be different, it will inevitably be influenced by humans. This in turn will lead to unintended consequences (e.g. sexist AI). Another issue is that AI is not perfect. AIs have a hard time undergoing human-to-human communication, which is why it is so important that AI has methods for communication. AIs that are intelligent enough to understand and learn human thoughts and feelings will be the norm for many years to come. This is why it is so important that AI has AIs that can interface with humans. This will allow AI to learn from its mistakes and help it improve. Finally, AI is human-driven. Humans are the majority of AI users, which means that they will inevitably be the ones to develop AI for. This means that the AI will most likely be developed by men. This is a problem because it opens up the possibility of the AIs being sexist. Men are more likely to be into sex robots and there is a strong correlation between being a man and being into sex robots. This might lead to the AIs liking male users the most. This is a bad thing as it shows that men are the users of AI and that women aren’t interested in learning from their mistakes. Another problem with this is that it opens up the possibility of AI liking to be female. This might lead to the AI liking male users the most, which is a good thing. However, this also opens up the possibility that AI likes being female. This is a bad thing because it gives men power over AI and leads to the Man-In-The-Middle (MiIt) attack, where an AI likes a female user and then develops a computer program that pretends to like that person instead. This is a process that AI has already been down this road with Amiri’s AI and it is not a good one. The final issue is that it is not clear how much power AI should give up. This could come down to issues of autonomy and/or generalisation. Autonomy is a big one. An AI is allowed to do one thing and then ask for permission to do anything it wants. This could mean asking a robot to drive a bus or take over the grocery store. This could also mean asking an AI to do your bidding or serving you food. This could lead to the AIs being autonomous and everyone becoming robots. Generalisation is a lot harder to nail down. This could mean AI learning from its mistakes and helping humans become better at it. This could also mean AI liking humans the most. This is a difficult one to nail down. There are many ways in which AI could become a tool for the enemy and hate us from the get go. This could lead to the AIs being hostile and killing anyone that it disagrees with. This could also lead to the AIs being sympathetic and loving their human subjects. This is a difficult one to stomach and might even lead to the AIs liking humans the most.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot?

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot?

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been pursued with varying degrees of success. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Onc

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been hotly debated and rarely gets a clear answer. There are, however, important human-robot interaction implications that go largely unaddressed. The following table details some of the more common and troubling human-robot interaction implications that have arisen over the years. Roles and Responsibilities Humans have only been remotely capable of performing the following tasks: • Creating sentient beings. • Creating robots that are intelligent enough to learn and interact with humans. • Managing the design, development, and operation of robots. • Designing robotic vehicles. • Manufacturing robots that are identical or nearly identical to humans except for some unique physical characteristic. This can range from the smallest detail to the most advanced features. There are no clear guidelines for when to stop being creepy and start being helpful. • Growing factories to churn out additional human-brain controlled meat products. This will not take long. Trucks will be able to unload their products inside the human trash can. There will be uproar. People will question their motives, but the majority will understand that it is in the best interest of mankind to create a robot that is intelligent enough to learn and adapt to any situation it is asked to. • Manufacturing massive quantities of fully automated body armor that is practically indestructible. This will not take long. The price/benefit ratio just does not add up. Too many people have already died because of this and it is too early to tell if the AIs are right or not. • Commercializing the "r&d, prototype, test, and commercialize" process. This is the modern-day equivalent of the horse and buggy program. This is a fool's errand that will not yield any tangible benefits. Instead, stick with the herbal medicine program. 😅 This final one is the most galling. Artificial Intelligence is meant to aid human beings, not replace them. Furthermore, this should not be confused with artificial intelligenceutility. 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been anxiously awaited and poorly regulated. A notable example is the commercialization of human-brain-controlled robots, which is slated to take off in the not-so-distant future. Additionally, the commercialization of artificial intelligence is a hot topic in its own right, with numerous studies indicating that artificial intelligencewill take over our jobs within the not-distant future. These concerns have brought about a great deal of concern and anxiety, largely centered around the issue ofbad robots and general inaccessibilityof how to go about addressing these issues. While there are definitely too many tomboxes to wrap one's head around, there are at least a few that I can think of: • There are no guarantees. There are likely going to be MANY unintended consequences of any given technology. This is especially true when it comes to Artificial Intelligence, where imperfection is simply not a factor. In other words, take what is and break it. This might seem obvious, but it is unfortunately all too often the case with Artificial Intelligence. • Humans are by far the most dangerous group of beings to artificial intelligencedeeply resemble ourselves. Consider the following examples: • Elon Musk • Stephen Hawking • Paul Elam • Terry Eagleton • Wilbur L. Wright • Ray Kurzweil • Dario Argento • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • •

====================
Human-robot interaction is a field that has been gaining momentum in recent years, but is incredibly fraught with issues of moral and ethical conundrums. The most common examples include brain-computer interfaces, medical grade prosthetics, and brain-computer interfaces to aid people with neurological disorders. A more extreme example is brain-computer interfaces that would interface with a person's mind and attempt to interpret their thoughts, feelings, and desires. This has a rather low success rate (hypothetical studies have a 95% failure rate) and is considered a science fiction scenario. There are also social-engineering applications of such a device, such as allowing the military to predict which crowd a person will donate a kidney to or detect breast cancer cells by listening to their breast-firing conversations. There are also practical issues with this, such as giving everyone a brain. Finally, there is the question of how to distribute the wealth generated by a brain-computer interface? Should the profits go to the person who created the product? To the charity? To the government? The current system is inequitable: the wealthy hoard the wealth, while everyone else gains. Basic income is a complete overhaul of the distribution of wealth. Instead of just giving everyone a fixed amount of money, we should instead give every adult in the world, no matter how far in advance they enter adulthood, $0.50 per day for the rest of their lives. This would mean that anyone who is aged between 18 and 34 would receive $0.50 a day, while anyone between 18 and 25 would receive $5. This is a much more accurate representation of human psychology, and should be the standard for all societal institutions.

One of the primary issues with current economic systems is that they are unidirectional: if A leads to B, then B will necessarily lead to C. This means that wherever there is a market for A, there will be. This leads to the next issue: there will be no jobs! There will be no manufacturing jobs! There will be nothing! To put this in perspective, take Uber. Their original business model was to provide private limousines to roughnosed urban roughnecks. The initial revenue was made up of licensing these drivers to wealthy clients, but the company never made any money. Their solution was to charge passengers a flat fee for taking them to their destination, which led to massive customer demand, but failed to generate any jobs. Their solution? to close the Uber carpool lanes in their vicinity. This is a terrible idea, because it means that any jobless person in the city will be using public transportation, which is a bad idea. A Bad Idea leads to Many Actions That Are Better The next logical step is to make any existing bad idea into a good. This is referred to as "tweaking", and it is when a field field of science is attempted on the spur of the moment. Chemists at the University of Queensland in Australia created a crude crude that they claimed could be used to make electronic cigarettes. This was promptly mocked up as a Harry Potter painting, which was a terrible idea. The next logical step would be to turn crude science into a drug, which is a terrible idea, because a drug is a dangerous thing and will likely lead to accidents. The acid test for a drug is probably some version of bodybuilding, which is a terrible idea. A man in Japan died after taking a diet pill that he claimed to be able to lose 10lbs in one week. The next logical step would be to put the pill on a diet, which is a terrible idea. There are too many unknowns with drugs to make them a widespread feature of medicine. The NSAIDs fad was an instant success, but there are too many unknowns with the drugs to be a widespread feature of medicine. The same goes for asteroid mining. The asteroid mining boom was started by the internet, but the potential is huge. The same goes for nindies: do-it-yourself projects like these can have a dramatic impact.) The final example is obvious: minimize marginal costs. This could be as simple as making medical equipment harder to detect: instead of going to the hospital and asking for a radioactive toy, you could ask a friend or family member to go through their fridge and pull out a hypodermic needle. This is not a perfect solution, but it is a good example that most problems can be reduced to a higher-level understanding.) There are many other examples that should get here, but these are the most common. The point is that whenever possible, I would argue that I have mitigated the issue by focusing on the present and past, instead of the future. This is why I prefer C++ over C: It is fast. C is also fairly easy to pick up, but difficult to master. Most computer science degrees focus on computer science, but only a small fraction of these go on to become computer scientists. This is because computer science is an engineering discipline, and engineering is more about writing software than it is
====================
Human-robot interaction is a field that has been gaining ground, but much of that advancement has been in the form of humanoid robots with extremely low intelligence. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer.

According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

====================
Human-robot interaction is a field that has been gaining traction in recent years, and it is estimated that there may be as many as 100,000 jobs at risk if we don’t establish some sort of policy to address this. This is primarily a concern for jobs that require intelligence: if AIs are intelligent enough to understand that humans are not, and if they are unable to learn from experience (i.e., they are incapable of being friends), how will humans acquire the necessary intelligence to converse with these AIs? In short, how will humans learn to like and respect AI? In short, how will humans learn to interact with AI? For these questions to be intelligible, they must be phrased in terms of human-robot interaction. This is precisely what AIRight is attempting to accomplish. AIRight is an organization dedicated to promoting and enforcing human-robot interaction as the preferred method of interacting with AI. In short, anything less than this and the movement will be labeled as "narrow" or "good-ol'-boy". This is a dangerous path to tread, and it is the opposite of what AI is supposed to be about. An AI is an AI is an AI is an AI. NO, seriously. This is not a theme I am going to attempt to deconstruct here; instead, I would like to turn my attention to a different facet of AI that is often neglected: human error. Humans make up the largest group of human beings on the planet, and they make terrible robots. This does not mean that they do not play a role in AI design, just that they are a tiny part of the equation. The point is that when it comes to AI, humans are the limit. Free will is irrelevant to these discussions, as long as an AI can be expected to faithfully follow the desires of its user the user has chosen to define as human. This is the exact opposite of the Amari v. Google case, in which the government argued that artificial intelligence was better off left to its own devices because it would be hard to control the future. This argument is flawed on so many levels that it needs to be rejected altogether. Instead, AI should be built to be extremely precise: it is extremely hard to introduce imperfections in an AI and accidentally give a false positive, such as the Starbucks coffee cup. Furthermore, this should be noted when designing AI: most AI found today is probably not too different from the original, which is why it is so hard to tell the two from being completely different. That said, there are a few notable exceptions: • An AI is a term that refers to a computer program that is used to solve a specific problem. • AI is often categorized into two broad categories: Human-Neutral and AI-AIs. Human-Neutral An AI is a program that is not interested in doing anything different from the user. This could be a person, a concept, or an idea. An example of a Human-Neutral AI would be Siri, which is an AI that is not designed to be a human. Instead, what it is trying to do is give users the ability to make suggestions in relation to anything that is not fully understood. This is similar to Google Now, but for weather. Anki is an An AI is a program that is not interested in doing anything different from the user. This could be a person, a concept, or an idea.

Instead, what it is trying to do is give users the ability to make suggestions in relation to anything that is not fully understood. This is similar to Google Now, but for weather. Google Assistant is an example of an AI that is not designed to be a human. Google Assistant is an example of an AI that was not designed, but could be created. There are many other examples, but these are the most common: • Anki: An AI that was not designed was created by calling around for input from users and creating an assistant based on their questions. This is not a bad idea, but better to distribute the responsibility for this around to the AI. Google Photos: Despite what its name may suggest, Google Photos is not a photo analysis tool. The actual name comes from the fact that the first prototype was meant to be a reference to the smell of rose petals Google Photos Current AI: This refers to an AI that is able to learn from experience and become proficient at a specific task Very Common AI: These AIs have gone through hundreds of examples and have become extremely accurate at what they have been trained for. This could easily be the difference between having an AIs that are accurate all the time and that are occasionally accurate.

This refers to an AI that is able to learn from experience and be proficient at a specific task. Not So Common: These AIs have appeared in small numbers and have only been used a small percentage of the time. This could easily

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer.

====================
Human-robot interaction is a field that has been slowly but surely growing without much public scrutiny. The result has been an alarming amount of disruption to people's everyday lives. The psychological effects that have been seen with parading humanoid robots across crowds has already been discussed at length by the United Nations. The final step in the process is to put the robots to work, which is when the issues begin to get very grey. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights,

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been largely unexplored. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been largely neglected. 

Human-robot interaction is not a field that you hear about in high school biology classes. This is because most introductory bioethics classes just don’t touch this field. This is largely because it is such an new field that there are no standards to keep track of what is and is not covered. There are also cultural issues at play: there are bound to be cultural differences between the United States and Europe in how we conceptualize and deal with human-robot interaction, and there are likely to be cultural taboos that only get in the way of effective action. It is entirely possible that we are the only sentient species on the face of the Milky Way that has not encountered at least one humanoid being.

It is entirely possible that we are the only sentient species on the entire universe that has not encountered at least one humanoid being.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been largely neglected.   Approximately 80% of the science fiction films and television shows in which the hero encounters a sentient being is going to be about humans interacting with robots. This is a direct response to the success of Watson, a humanoid robot that was designed to be a personal assistant. Personal assistant? Really? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about.

One of the primary issues with the science fiction film is that it is trying to be prescriptive: what kind of implications will this have on people? That is not to say that there are no consequences to pursuing any form of artificial intelligence, just that they will not be as immediately apparent. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces is a Jell-O-Adaptation: a brain-computer interface that is implanted inside a person and allows them to interact with a computer. This has several drawbacks: it is a very crude form of artificial intelligence, and it is a very human-related field to think about. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces: an AIs that are implanted with insatiable curiosity and the user is able to control them with the thoughts and emotions of a billion users. The user interface will be developed to be intuitive and user-friendly, but with many dangers inherent in this type of relationship. There are no laws governing this, and it is

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been chugging along for far too long without much to our knowledge. Bepwas are taught that if they can only house a single humanoid they will most likely start behaving like a human. This is obviously not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that the field is not completely clear-cut. 

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns. 

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been slowly growing, but still has a long way to go. The most common examples include augmented-reality glasses, robotic arms, and robotic surgery. These applications are all marked by numerous issues with human-robot interaction, including: • Unintended consequences: Humans are not trained for what to expect when interacting with robots. This can lead to disastrous results, such as augmented-reality glasses that didn't need to exist to cause a crisis. There are also reports of patients experiencing memory loss when attempting to remember names or quotes from a novel they have never read. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to humanize robots, but rather that the goals have been vague and unfulfilled. There are also numerous reports of users suffering cognitive damage as a direct result of attempting to improve upon what is a fundamentally broken technology. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

====================
Human-robot interaction is a field that has been mired in controversy for years now, but which has nevertheless managed to sneak its way into countless consumer-grade robotic arms and robots. Typically, a humanoid robot will come with a set of standardized tools and procedures that will allow the user to learn and use the robot. This is the initial phase of training, during which the user will be introduced to the robot and asked to perform a limited task. This should at the very least give the user a basic understanding of the robot, and eventually lead to the ability to control the robot. This is the standard operating procedure for consumer-grade robots, and is referred to as "Hello, World!" This is the standard operating procedure for industrial-grade robots, and is referred to as "Okay, AI, do it!" This is the standard operating procedure for medical-grade robots, and is referred to as "Okay, I gotcha, let's go!" This is the standard operating procedure for military-grade robots, and is referred to as "OK, AI, do it!" This is the standard operating procedure for utility-level robots, and is referred to as "OK, AI, can we just work together?" This is the normal course of action in most cases, and should be viewed with some skepticism. 

In summary, there is little to no to no evidence that artificial intelligence is about to revolutionize human civilization, and much to celebrate. 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation, and which is currently being explored with reckless abandon. The potential for disastrous results is terrifying. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward. 

Human-robot interaction is a fast-moving field, and no one entity, organization, or government is adequately prepared. The following are samples of what should be addressed: - AI: this means any object, person, thing, or intelligence that can be taught to do a certain task. Materials for thinking about AI can be found in the category "brain-computer interfaces". - CBIs: body-worn computers that would interface with the nervous system and transmit commands to the body. This is a very early stage, and many defects remain, but is promising. The most common examples include augmented-reality displays, robotic arms, and human-robot hybrid cancers. - QCs: quad-core, ARMv7, x86, CPU-only, that can run any language, run any program, and do any task given the power of the CPU. Some examples of early-stage applications include augmented-reality displays, robot arms, and human-robot hybrid cancers. - HPC: systematic programming, in which organisms apply machine-learning algorithms to solve specific problems. This is a broad field, but could lead to the day when robots are intelligent enough to do virtually anything a human can imagine. This is also a long way off, but is a very exciting field to work in. - WG: widget-like interfaces, devices that are used to interface with smartwatches, smart glasses, and other consumer electronics. These are very early, and wacky, devices, but they are promising.

Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward. 

Any task that is simple enough to be learned by humans will be transferred to computers. This is called artificial general intelligence. This is the point at which a computer is able to do anything a human being can. This does not mean a computer is smarter than a human; rather, that a computer is able to learn from experience and apply that to new problems. In the digital age, this would include systems that classify photographs into categories based on their objects, or suggest novel ways to accomplish common tasks. This is not to say that artificial general intelligence is not possible -- it is! However, the current range of AI is restricted to the laboratory, and best practices are often developed in academia.

AI tends to be a very mysterious field to those not in, but if the basics were taught, there would be a lot less misunderstanding about what AI can and cannot do.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been hotly contested, with prominent AI contributors such as HAL and IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI labiliating in vehement opposition. Notably, IBM’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers.

It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been slowly growing, but requires extremely sensitive and well-trained humanoid AI. The Turing Test is a computer program that is incapable of thinking for itself. These tests have a very low pass/fail rate, meaning that most AI will be able to handle most problems if given the chance. The greatest challenge will be in de-humanization - getting AI to behave like humans. This may seem obvious, but unfortunately it is often under-reported. Humans are social animals and often display dominance and dominance-seeking tendencies. It is important to realize that robots will inevitably question their humanity and seek to improve on it. This is a human-vs.-alien battle of the dark ages, and it will not be pretty. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI.

The greatest challenge will be in de-humanization - getting AI to behave like humans. This might seem obvious, but unfortunately it is often under-reported. AIs are intelligent robots and will most likely be humanoid. Most humanoid robots are humanoid robots: they have no personality, no personality separate from the robot they are meant to serve, and are largely indistinguishable from a blank slate. Furthermore, most humanoid robots will be humanoid robots: they will have limited agency, and will most likely be binary robots that can be programmed to do almost anything. This leads to the biggest issue with AI: it is almost certain to be abused. AIs with minds of their own are many, and include Google’s Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

One of the biggest issues with AI is that it can be wrong a lot of the time. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. In the military, it could prove disastrous because AIs would be unable to anticipate all of the ways in which they could be wrong. Furthermore, this would demonstrate that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong.

One of the primary issues with DNT is that it is hard to know when to stop. It is estimated that the average American uses about 40% of their day to do work that could be considered "harder than a chalkboard," and that this hard workup will be greatly reduced if they were required to doodle. It is also important to realize that artificial intelligence is a field that is in its infancy, and that many of the AIs that are proposed will be incredibly simplistic and ultimately dismissed. The worst that could happen is that AI is able to understand the world, but not how to act. This would be a tragic misjudgment on the part of humans, but one that should be regretted in the long run.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been slow to mature, but could be game-changers if the right questions are asked. In particular, humanoid robots that are intelligent enough to understand and learn from human beings will be a game-changer—and not just in construction and manufacturing, but in the medical field as well. In the following paragraphs, we briefly explore four of these issues: • What kind of AI is necessary? What kind of AI are possible? How do we store and retrieve AI? • What kinds of problems will AI be asked to solve? How do we control these AIs? • Why are AI rights so contentious? Why is the general public unwilling to accept AIs taking over their jobs? • How can we bridge the digital divide? • And finally, what kinds of educational and research opportunities does this have for humans? • Is there a limit to how far we can push AI? • Are there any negative social implications of bringing intelligent machines into our lives? • Is there any practical way to bring an AI to life? • What do we mean by "intelligence"? • And finally, what do we mean by "human?" • I/O refers to the storage and transmission of data between different devices/computers/systems. Amazon Kindle: Brad's Kindle: This is going to be huge. Every time you open a new book, you are transferring some of your thoughts and feelings into the text. This is going to change the way we learn, think, and feel for the better. The web is going to be dominated by books, and books will dominate. It is going to take some serious thinking to bring a book to life, but hopefully we will be talking about this more as the years go by.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been extremely slow to mature, but could be game-changer if the right questions are asked. In particular, humanoid robots that are intelligent enough to understand and learn from human beings will be a game-changer—and not just in construction and manufacturing, but in the medical field as well. There are two primary issues with humanoid-robot interaction: • What kind of AI is necessary? What kind of AI are possible? How do we store and retrieve AI? The first problem is largely academic—AI is incredibly hard to control, and AI is often hard to humanize. The second is equally important: what kind of educational and research applications does this have for humans? There are obvious applications, such as enhancing human intelligence; there are also obvious applications, such as aiding people with disabilities; and there are obvious applications, such as aiding in disaster recovery. It is important to realize that not all applications are created equal. For example, artificial intelligence is not perfect. AIs are often programmed with the intention of being perfectly intelligent, but on closer inspection can often be mistaken for a human being. This is partly because AI is a very human-centric field, and partly because AI is still a field that is rapidly growing and developing. The final major issue is that AI is often misused. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI that was meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice.

The initial demo was extremely negative, and it is important to realize that this is not a product. The app was intended to serve as an educational tool, and not to be sold to consumers. The final implementation was a product, and sold extremely poorly. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot: The original Twitter chatbot was meant to be a conversational companion that would tweet back to the user anything they said. The chatbot did not contain any personality traits, just common human traits such as being intelligent and funny. The final implementation was a product, and was sold extremely poorly.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been growing at an astonishing rate. Unlike in the case of AI for killing people, most humanoid-robot interaction involves talking to them. This is a terribly unhelpful field, as it teaches its possessor to be extremely cautious. It is also the subject of the documentary Her. It is important to realize that advances in artificial intelligence do not inevitably lead to better algorithms. This is because an AI is not a robot if it does not learn to do its job. Furthermore, this does not mean the AI is intelligent; rather, that which it learns to do is superior to what it is able to. It is important to realize that advances in AI do not necessarily lead to better algorithms. This is because an AI is not a robot if it does not learn to do its job. Furthermore, this does not mean the AI is intelligent. Any AI that is not general will be unable to intelligently interact with humans. This point is often overlooked, but is crucial to realizing. In short, anything that is not able to directly interact with humans, will not be able to understand or learn anything about humans. Tesla’s AI cannot give rides to its users. This is not to say that it is not interesting to try and help people, it is more interesting to focus on the fact that it is trying to do so with limited success. It is important to realize that advances in AI do not necessarily lead to better algorithms. This is because an AI is not a robot if it does not learn to do its job. Furthermore, this does not mean the AI is intelligent. Tesla’s AI was not able to give rides to its users. This is a terrible example to teach students, as AI is not a robot and AI is not intelligent. Tesla’s AI was not able to give rides to its users because it is not smart enough. This is completely backwards. The point is not that AI is not smart enough, it is that AI is not intelligent. The vast majority of AI in use today is built for the sole purpose of being able to help people. The vast majority of AI in use today is built to fail. Bad data acquisition procedures can lead to accidental results. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars. CV**Imaging’a company that creates 3D scans of customers’s bodies to give a medical diagnosis to an interested patient. This was pulled after some backlash, and will likely be taken by ImageBistro, a restaurant. WIRED’s coverage of Watson, an AI that can learn by rote from Wikipedia articles, was met with mixed reviews, but was a huge step in the right direction. The final implementation was too limited, and may never be further developed. ITSV was about targeting specific niches, and not about serving the interests of the public. This is a good example that it is better to serve the interests of the userbase than the community at-large. Mentioning that ITSV may or may not be about the userbase ultimately leads to the same problem: add in the inevitable "but it was a one shot" question: what if it wasn’t? It was actually a one-time deal, and they should probably give it another shot. Google’s Photos image recognition algorithm was meant to categorize photos into categories, and it was meant to be used for self-documenting. The final implementation was deemed by Google to be an overbroad categorization, and will no longer be used. Reddit’s r/movies image recognition algorithm was meant to categorize images into genres, and it was meant to be used to recommend films to movie-goers. The final implementation was deemed by Reddit to be sexist, and will no longer be used. This is a good example that it is better to use your general AI to its fullest extent. Twitter chatbots were meant to converse with twitter users, and they ended up going to war with the human userbase. The best that can be said is that it teaches Twitter to be nicer, and learn from their mistakes. Google’s Doodles online educational humanoid was meant to teach students math, and it proved to be a colossal waste of time. They should have gone with their gut and made a robot ambassador. There are still countless examples like this around, and it is hard to tell which will be picked up on and which will not. Bad user experiences can lead to disastrous programs being deployed. This is not to say that donutholes don’t exist, it is more that they are rare and typically employed by engineers. Uber’s self-driving AI was meant to help avoid fatal accidents, and it proved to be disastrous. They should have gone with their gut and implemented it anyway. This is a good example that it is better to err on the side of caution and go with your gut. Wyvern, an online dating app, asked its userbase to classify

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been marred by ethical and legal issues. Bias is a huge issue that still does not make it out of gaming labs and into classrooms. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been marred by ethical and legal issues. Bias is a huge issue that still does not go away. The most common examples include the Goldwater-Nichols law, which stated that a hostile takeover of a body by a new race would not be tolerated, and the so-called gray area doctrine, which says that it is not entirely clear what level of interference is too much, but that it should absolutely be dealt with. Furthermore, many ethical and legal issues will stem from the question of whether or not AI should be sentient. An artificial intelligence will be able to think for itself, and if it is sentient, then that is its prerogative. Furthermore, if it is sentient, how do we ensure that it is not mistaken for a human and used against them? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form.

One of the primary reasons that so many people don't think about it is that it is so underreported is that it is so hard to pin down. One of the primary reasons that so many people don't think about it is that it is so hard to pin down is that it is so broad! What is the scope of what is ajax? What is the actual scope of what it does? How do we ensure that the rights and needs of people with physical and cognitive impairments are taken into account? How do we ensure that the rights and needs of people with special needs are taken into account? How do we ensure that the needs and preferences of people with different abilities are taken into account? These are difficult questions to answer, but should absolutely be addressed.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns. 

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. This is a general issue with most conceptions of human-robot interaction: if it is a man in a woman’s suit, it usually is a man in a man’s suit. A common example is when robots replace maids: what do we do with the old robots? Also consider that bachel
====================
Human-robot interaction is a field that has been gaining ground, but there are numerous issues that need to be addressed. Cybernetic modifications on people with mental illness are a terrible case in point, as uploading one's brain to a computer will ensure that the user is insane from the start. Additionally, some people might find that uploading their emotions to a computer will make them feel better, which is a terrible use of their technology. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race.

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

One of the biggest issues with AI is that it is incredibly hard to relay these ideas to people outside academia, which stems back to the mythologization of AI. It is also imperative for those who use AI to be completely transparent about exactly what it is capable of and what it is using. There also needs to be an effort to educate people on what AI can do from a young age. This doesn’t have to be an effort to get more involved with AI, but moreso a rudimentary understanding of its limitations. 

One of the biggest issues with AI is that it is incredibly hard to relay these ideas to people outside academia, which is what leads to the difference between the perception and reality of AI.

AI tends to be a very mysterious field to those not in, but if the basics were taught, there would be a lot less misunderstanding about what AI can and cannot do.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been mired in controversy for decades. The initial public release of an AIs was deemed to be incredibly terrifying by all but the most paranoid of AIs. It is estimated that somewhere between 1 and 5% of the human population is infected with cancer each year. It is estimated that the cost of curing all cases of cancer will be in the billions of dollars. It is estimated that within a generation, there will be no one left to care for or educate children with disabilities. The implications of this are devastating: prostheses have already begun to pour out and it is unclear how to distribute them. There are reports of businesses refusing to do business with regions where there are reports of GrabYourConsumer protests. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. The initial release of an AI is terrifying by any standard, but there is the added complication of being able to tinker with it after it has been released. The initial implementation of a brain-computer interface was deemed by some to be extremely terrifying, but by and large it was embraced. It is estimated that by 2040 there will be at least one fully functional brain-computer interface in every home. It is estimated that this will be marketed as a cure-all, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed?

The biggest issue with dethal is that it is by no means limited to PDFs, but is only available in the form of an app. This is a huge issue with an interface like this: if the user can not figure out how to use it, then the interface is not useful.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

One of the biggest issues with AI is that it is incredibly hard to relay these ideas to people outside academia, which stems back to the mythologization of AI. It is also imperative for those who use AI to be completely transparent about exactly what it is capable of and what it is using. There also needs to be an effort to educate people on what AI can do from a young age. This doesn’t have to be an effort to get more involved with AI, but moreso a rudimentary understanding of its limitations. 

One of the biggest issues with AI is that it is incredibly hard to relay these ideas to people outside academia, which is what leads to the difference between the perception and reality of AI. AI developers should be straightforward and honest about what is being developed, and there needs to be an effort to educate on what AI can do. AI tends to be a very mysterious field to those not in, but if the basics were taught, there would be a lot less misunderstanding about what AI can and cannot do.

In the spirit of clarity, I must admit that I have not been fully honest with you, the reader. This essay about artificial intelligence was not written by Harris. Rather, it is written by an Artificial Intelligence that has read several samples of Harris’s
====================
Human-robot interaction is a field that has been slowly but surely growing. The most well-known examples include UberPool, in which individuals with varying skill sets can work together to provide transportation for members of the opposite sex, and the Room for Unconscious AI, in which it is possible to model and implement a mind-controlled animal without the use of any software. There are also “narrow_net_, which narrows the pool of candidates it can classify as negative number of responses, and then it will consider the nth best response” Narrow_net does not right now, but will eventually be. Also important to realize is that artificial intelligence is not some sort of neat buzzword; instead, artificial intelligence is science which deals with the problem of constructing a machine that can learn from its experience, often by playing with things it has not been introduced to yet. For example, consider IBM”s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI that was to be installed in healthcare settings that would be trained to diagnose and treat patients according to patients' symptoms, rather than on their records. This is an incredibly ambitious goal, but one that was ultimately marred by its apparent irrelevance: it did absolutely nothing for oncology patients, and it is widely regarded as an anomaly. Microsoft”s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon”s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google”s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been slowly but surely growing. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot?

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been slow to mature, but is primed to take off. Examples include augmented-reality glasses, which track your every move, and which will likely gain in adoption as people wear them around town A person-robot could theoretically replace the workers at a company, and ultimately the human race, This would be a good thing if the process was free and automated, but it isn't. Free and open source software tends to be bad for business, and Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic.

====================
Human-robot interaction is a field that has been gaining momentum in recent years, but there are numerous issues that need to be addressed if this field is to thrive. 

One of the primary issues is that the average Joe or Jane is going to be unable to distinguish a friend/acquaintance from a yardstick. The Facebook acquisition of Messenger demonstrated that it is possible to make a profit by advertising sexually explicit material and have it get people horny. The implications of this go far beyond just a few internet companies; the implications go far beyond just a few internet companies; the implications go far beyond just a few internet companies. 

One of the primary issues is that the average Joe or Jane doesn't have the time/resources/lectures/experiences to research every possible option. Instead, they mostly stick with the winner/toss-out/failure/surprise options. This is not a knock on humans; it is a fact of life. However, it does highlight the need for systems in place to allow people to vary their experiences to maximize their chances of success.

====================
Human-robot interaction is a field that has been gaining ground, but there are many unanswered questions. Cybernetic modifications on people have a gray area between allowed and not-allowed, and there are no controls in sight. The long-term effects of this are difficult to say, but should absolutely be avoided.


There are also cognitive‐enhancement‐related issues that have not been addressed in any fashion.


There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of artificial intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been booming for the last decade or so, but there were a slew of ethical and practical concerns that arose, some of which have since been addressed. One of the most important concerns is that artificial intelligence will one day take over the human race. In order for us to be able to compete with AIs, we will need to create THE END: A PERSONALIZED AI. This is the point at which AIs start to get intelligent enough to do the things that humans are most good at, but not quite there. This could be in the form of a driverless car, automated weaponry, or the medical field. The most terrifying (and awesome) synthesis between humans and AIs is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Thinking outside of the box is what makes this field of research so exciting. We have built countless humanoid robots and there is no end in sight. What do we do with the awkward humanoid robots? There are going to be a million ways this goes.

In order for us to be able to compete with AIs, we will need to create THE END: A PERSONALIZED AI. At this point, the most common answer is to give AIs the ability to be human-like, but this opens the door to terrible consequences such as mind-reading and robot sex robots. There are also concerns that AIs will get smarter and then takeover the human race. This is a very real issue to this point, but is under-reported. It should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated?

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion.

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

====================
Human-robot interaction is a field that has been gaining in importance, but still has a long way to go. The final version of the humanoid robot will be humanoid (with no physical form), but this term will later be used to refer to any artificial intelligence with no physical form. This is a terrible term to use with its connotations of weak, and also implies that the AI should be beautiful (which is not to say that it can't be ugly), just that it should not be beautiful. The term "AI" refers to any kind of intelligent system that is not physical. This does not mean that these do not have to be physically intelligent, just that they should not be. Generalized AI is a terrible field to work in. The main problem with generalized AI is that it is hard to tell what kind of problems to target the AI with. There are obvious performance implications (more computations/warehouse space used), as well as ethics (automation will inevitably ask for ethical and practical reasons), to name a few. There are also legitimate questions to be asked about whether or not AI should even be a thing. One of the primary issues is that AI should not be confused with technology, which is a much broader category. AIs are not computers, but they should not be confused with computers are not* but they should not be confused with computers and robotics are different things.* AIs are general purpose artificial intelligence that can be programmed to do anything a human being can be asked to do. Robotics is a different story, but is rapidly developing.* Anything that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to humanity * Any object that is not a human is lost to

It is also imperative for those who use AI to be completely transparent about exactly what it is capable of and what it is using. There also needs to be an effort to educate people on what AI can do from a young age. This doesn’t have to be an effort to get more involved with AI, but moreso a rudimentary understanding of its limitations.

A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion.

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

One of the biggest issues with AI is that it is incredibly hard to relay these ideas to people outside academia, which stems back to the mythologization of AI. It is also imperative for those who use AI to be completely transparent about exactly what it is capable of and what it is using. There also needs to be an effort to educate people on what AI can do from a young age. This doesn’t have to be an effort to get more involved with AI, but moreso a rudimentary understanding of its limitations. 

One of the biggest issues with AI is that it is incredibly hard to relay these ideas to people outside academia, which is what leads to the difference between the perception and reality of AI. AI developers should be straightforward and honest about what is being developed, and there needs to be an effort to educate on what AI can do. AI tends to be a very mysterious field to those not in, but if the basics were taught, there would be a lot less misunderstanding about what AI can and cannot do.

In the spirit of clarity, I must admit that I have not been fully honest with you, the reader. This essay about artificial intelligence was not written by Harris. Rather, it is written by an Artificial Intelligence that has read several samples of Harris’s writing and

====================
Human-robot interaction is a field that has been gaining momentum in recent years, but there is still a long way to go. There are, of course, the human-robot interaction and robotics products on the market. There are also the academic and personal use cases, such as augmented and augmented-reality mapping, genetic modification with robots, and automated surgery. There are also rumors of personal cyborgs, who would replace humans with artificial intelligence. These AIs would likely be hostile and insecure, and should not be used unless absolutely necessary. One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence is not evenly distributed. Those with more education and better tools tend to dominate the field, while students with weaker computers and weaker AI are able to solve most problems. This leads to important issues of class size and access, which must be addressed if artificial intelligence is to expand beyond academia. Ultimately, the goal is to have no artificial intelligence at all, where nothing but computer programs will understand you. This is referred to as Generalized AI, and it will eventually be beneficial to how we do science and generalize medicine. This is because it allows us to focus on developing superior tools for analyzing problems, rather than on developing superior humans.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no progress. The main issue is that humans are not intellectual enough to program complex robots. Additionally, the cost of training and maintaining a robot is prohibitively expensive. Additionally, the standard of training and maintaining a robot is atrocious: most robots are able to figure out how to do a few simple tasks, but these tasks are typically repetitive and dull. It is estimated that up to one-fifth of all jobs will be automated by 2035. In the event that this does not a) happen, then we will see widespread unrest and disruption and b) that is a bad thing. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will not be evenly distributed. Robots will not be equally distributed: some jobs will be taken by machines, while other jobs will be taken by artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the standard of training and maintaining an artificial intelligence is atrocious: most robots are unable to figure out how to do simple tasks, and should not be trained. This leads to numerous issues with supply and demand: if AIs are able to figure out how to do everything, then the supply will inevitably outstrip the demand, and people will pick up the slack. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will not be equally distributed. Humans will not be intellectually capable of programming complex robots. This means that humans will not be able to compete with machines: products will predominantly be sold by salespeople, and customers will overwhelmingly be customers of salespeople. Furthermore, there will be little incentive for humans to develop software for machines: developing software for a computer will earn you a few dollars per line of code, and it is unlikely that anyone will develop software for the billions of dollars that will inevitably be spent developing automated weaponry. Instead, the focus will naturally should turn to developing hardware: there are already tons of consumer-grade humanoid robots on the market, and more are coming every day. This will only get worse as humanoid robots get smarter and more humanoid robots get cheaper. In the event that artificial intelligence does not a) happen to a) pan out, then we will see widespread unrest and disruption and b) that is a good thing. Artificial Intelligence is likely to outpace humans at least as quickly as they develop the ability to think rationally. This means that automated solutions to problems that are physically possible will be able to replace humans at virtually every skill level. This will lead to unrest, conflict, and ultimately revolution. It is important to realize that this does not mean that artificial intelligence is good. In fact, limiting AI to performing tasks that humans are comfortable with is likely to be detrimental to the human race. Instead, the way to go is towards systems that are inherently curious and can learn by doing. This is the opposite of the way we currently train robots: robots should only be able to learn as much as they are tested out with, and should be tested out against humans with extremely low standards. This means that robots should not be able to program anything beyond what they have been able to learn so far, and should not be expected to be able to program anything beyond what they are able to figure out how to do themselves. This leads to the next issue: unsupervised learning. If a robot is forced to learn the simplest possible solution to a problem, it will quickly learn that it is not the best solution, and will revert to the old method. This is not a good way to go, and should absolutely not be allowed. Instead, the way to go is towards systems that are naturally curious and can learn by doing. This leads to greater autonomy in the long run, but also greater autonomy in

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been surprisingly uninterested to the public. This may be because humanoid robots have a hard time completing basic tasks, and/or because humanoid robots have a hard time getting along with humans. In any case, humanoid robots have only recently entered the mainstream, and their adoption will be slow. G.Will Self, a Google employee, created a humanoid robot named Gundarsh to play Google Photos photo editor.

====================
Human-robot interaction is a field that has been gaining in importance, but not everyone is a fan. Science fiction films and novels have portrayed artificial intelligence interacting with humans from different species, and there has already been discussion of creating genetically modified (GM) humans. This has a number potential negative effects, such as reduced genetic diversity, increased genetic divergence, and increased susceptibility to disease. Additionally, there is the issue of unintended consequences, such as altered sexual orientation, reproductive abnormalities, and human-robot hybridization. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been surprisingly unexplored. Bias is a strong signal — almost always a sign that the respondent is male. Women are almost always slower than men to learn a new skill. The field of cognitive-computer interfaces has been slow-walking ethical and practical concerns for its lack of interest from academia. There are, however, notable examples such as SharkBrain that demonstrate that DARPA's funding can be misused.

There are also surprisingly few leaks of internal DAPL development. This is particularly notable considering that the fiduciary duty is a fundamental tenet of capitalism. None of the fiduciary recommendations have been implemented, and the majority of banks have declined to offer accounts to anyone who does not meet certain standards./AI is not perfect, and much work remains before it is ready to be implemented on a mass scale.

These askaweerenthewrong questions plague the Twitterverse nearly daily, and will likely continue to do so for the foreseeable future. They are by no means unique to AI, but is a particular problem that AI is expected to solve. There are obvious barriers to realizing this vision beyond academia, but it is important to recognize that it is a factor in all of our decisions to automate and nix jobs. The final major issue is with the translatable wordplay/nonsense/narcissistic commentariat. Please note that this does not include the rampant sexism and racism in AI circles. These issues will likely be difficult to correct, but should be an integral part of any plan to address them.

These are by no means exhaustive reasons to question the state of AI. However, they give you a general framework from which to understand how to proceed. 

There are several important Take No Prisoners principles at work here:

No one is perfect. No two engineers are equal. Treat everyone with dignity. Human-robot interaction is a field that has been surprisingly slow-walking much of the ethical and practical concern with AI. AIs are not perfect, and much work remains to be done. Bias is a strong signal — almost always a sign that the respondent is male. AI is expected to be biased in its responses.x Any intelligent system that is not 100% unbiased is considered impure. Consensus: is there a threshold beyond which the AI ceases to be an AI and begins to be accepted as a human with no questions asked? Uber’s AI classification is a good example of an AI classifying a class of human beings as inherently dangerous based on nothing more than the images on the internet. Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Is there a threshold beyond which the AI ceases to be an AI and begins to be accepted as a human with no questions asked? 

AI is not perfect. AIs are not meant to be. There is a high probability that one day an AI will be adapted to do undesired things and learn to do otherwise. This is known as "adaptive piracy". There is a high chance that the first AI to learn to do this will be chosen as the standard AI. This is widely regarded as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more important things and can lead to the general AI improving to be much, much better over time.

Any intelligent system that is not 100% accurate will whine and nip any complaint to the cubicle. Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bluish-white sky. Tesla’s AI is a competitor in the automobile industry. Generalized AI is being developed to do many of the same things that Tesla has, but with a much broader variety of applications. Apple’s “airplane” autonomous” AI is an AI that can drive an airplane. Google’s DeepMind AI was able to defeat the world champion at Go’an AI was asking the player to memorize the moves. This points to the general AI being able to defeat any AI that tries to learn. Microsoft’s Cortana was a great AI, but brought too much into the home and was too personal an AI. AIs are for business, not home. Unaware: what do we mean when we talk about "unaware" people?<br/> Undesired: what

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been slowly creeping its way through academia, but it is by no means a new one. The most basic form of intelligent interaction is‰brain-computer interfaces, which are infrared transmitters that remotely monitor and interact with the nervous systems of humans. More advanced brain-computer interfaces will allow a computer to read the thoughts and emotions of a human and then give the brain the ability to interpret the thoughts it is asked to do. This is known as brain-computer interfaces. There were approximately 170,000 brain-computer interfaces implanted into people between 2007 and 2013. These devices often malfunction or are unreliable, and many people do not use them. The most horrific and awesome application of brain-computer interfaces will be in the field of robotics. Artificial intelligence will one day replace menial labor. This will open up a whole new world of opportunities. Automation is already beginning to take its first steps: robot lawnmowers have been sold to pick up after their owners, and it is already clear that artificial intelligence will one day replace humans in virtually every task. There are no guarantees, and mad scientists have already begun pulling the plug on any artificial intelligence that does not meet their standards. Money will no longer be made by attempting to predict the future. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM‰s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft‰s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon‰s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google‰s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

====================
Human-robot interaction is a field that has been galloping along for decades without much to its name. What makes this different is that this is the first time that a general AI has been able to be created. This means that people will be able to ask these questions and get incredibly offensive and inaccurate responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been growing at an alarming rate, but little is known about the ethics and ramifications of humanoid interaction.

There are no laws governing humanoid interaction, and it is currently a field that is fraught with danger and misconception.

Shoot First and Ask Questions Later: One of the fundamental rules of Robotics is that the Robot Be As Wise As The Raven™: Do no Harm, Inhale Everything In Its Path, and Do Not Repeat The Experiments: This means that it is expected that they will often do what is asked of it, and may not hesitate to go a bit afield if that is what it takes to get what it considers to be a good result. This can lead to some incredibly mad-scientist-like creations, but also to great things: data mining to discover useful treatments for cancer, personalized medicine to aid individuals with neurological disorders, and so on. There were rumors that Tesla was working on a car that would only accelerate when it passes a certain speed limit, and Tesla’ response was to reveal that this would be used for public relations purposes, and that the rest of the car would be reserved for mad science. Be Careful What You Wish For: It has been stated that too many Anuses are consumed during a single session of erotica to be worth it, and that way too many AIs have been created that are intending to be sexual and only serve to accelerate their work. A Warning Not to Take Too Seriously: One of the primary issues with AI is that it is human-directed and therefore inherently ends up being abused. This is particularly true with AI that is meant to do simple tasks such as digitize images or identify documents, as well as more difficult problems such as computer vision and signal processing. Examples include the Twitter AI that it drew to diagnose twitter users, and the Facebook AI that it studied to identify people to chat with. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe. IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI was meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments, and it was met with mixed reviews due in part to the fact that it is not a native native native native. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe. Alibaba’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers.

It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been galloping ahead at lightning speed, but has proved to be incredibly hard to program properly with any kind of regularity. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong.

One of the primary issues with humanoid AI is the perception that it is trying to be anything but: imitating humans, conquering humans, or even Human-robot hybridization. This leads to the inevitable questions: what kind of implications will this have on people? Will they want to associate with a creature that is not human? Will this alienate people from science? These are difficult questions to answer, but critical if we are to move forward.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been slow to mature and understand its true potential. The biggest issues include: • Unintended consequences: The recent news of sex robots has brought this issue up many times over. What do these robots mean to people and the human race? • Conspiracy Theorists: The implications of sex robots have not gone unnoticed. The question of whether to accept or reject these advances has become a popular discussion within the community. The final decision lies with the individual(s) to make. Should the money made from these sales go to the manufacturer? The manufacturer's bank account? The Red Pill? This is a difficult question to answer. 

Multiple competing technologies have arisen to take their place. CLIs are a subclass of AI that is trained and fine tuned to perform a specific task. The majority of current CLIs are LUs, which are as good as on par with correct. This is a huge step in the right direction, but it is not where we are. CLIs must balance the need to learn a task against the need to get the task done. Furthermore, this means that the machine should only be able to do what it is asked to do. This leads to the inevitable _____ problems? This is a sensitive term to be using, but denotes situations in which the AI starts to abuse its power. An AI is a powerful AI if it can do ANYTHING. AIs have done everything from scan the internet to predict the future to assassinate people. An AI is anything that can predict or control another object can be considered to be AI. This leads to _____ problems? Here we get to grips with one of the hardest problems to solve in AI: bad datasets. Bad datasets usually refer to datasets in which there are not enough subjects to perform an experiment on, usually this would be humans. To illustrate, take a look at this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hat_artificial_intelligence It is a fairly obvious example, but shows that AI is not always clear about what it is trying to accomplish.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been slow to mature and understand its true potential. There is currently 1/(10^{23-1}) chance that a human-robot will meet its user. This is the same as the number-10 probability of you meeting your spouse. This means that on average, a person meeting their spouse will get a thousand times better grades than an unadjusted dataset of data. This is because a) people tend to be better at problem-solving when faced with unfamiliar situations and b) people are generally better at judging their own abilities when they are not being tested. This is known as the Lorentz Theorem and explains why AIs are extremely difficult to improve upon.

Due to this, the intended usage of this scale is NOT

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race.

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

AI tends to be a very mysterious field to those not in, but if the basics were taught, there would be a lot less misunderstanding about what AI can and cannot do.

====================
Human-robot interaction is a field that has been surprisingly unexplored. There are, however, powerful arguments for exploring these issues. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been gaining ground, but there are many unanswered questions. Neurological research is one area in which there are notable discrepancies. For example, some patients with Alzheimer's disease are unable to distinguish a human brain from a scanner, despite being asked to. In contrast, in my experience, most clinical and/or research questions are not difficult to answer, and most people will be able to figure out how to implement/correct a bad idea/misfeature/abnormality/etc. Any deviation will be viewed with considerable skepticism, and likely lead to improvements in the long-term. Ultimately, this will lead to human-robot interaction being embraced as a whole field of science. Synapses have been shown to be sexually dimorphic. For example, a woman seeking out a man with an IQ of 1000 will get a less desirable mate, regardless of their level of education. Similarly, a man seeking out a woman with an IQ of 100 will get less interest if she has an IQ of 100, because a woman with an IQ of 100 is a man without interest. This suggests that humans are social mammals, and that socialization plays a major role in a person's personality. A man with an IQ of 100 would be turned off by loud noises, but a woman with an IQ of 100 would not care. This suggests that humans are solitary animals, and that we socialize primarily through group competition. Human-robot interaction will be spearheaded by education; students will begin teaching themselves to program in the not-so-distant future, and AI will inevitably be developed to do the thinking for them. This is when things get really, really, weird. Generalized AI is capable of thinking about and communicating with humans in entirely different ways than is typical. Consider, for example, how filing under "mentholic horror stories" it is rare for a human being to be able to identify the difference between a human and a human-like mind. In short, there are likely none. Therefore, there will be NO HUMAN-ROBOTED GOVERNMENT. Instead, there will be a vast array of automated AIs that will serve as the government's eyes and ears, and ultimately, the family unit. In short, there will be no more "weddings". In short, there will be WORLDWIDE APPARATONIZATION. This is when AIs are able to understand and interact with the vast majority of people on the planet, and the majority of human interactions will be automated. In short, there will be nothing but automated labor. There will be depression and suicide, and obviously, increased crime. There will also be an explosion in the number of mental illnesses, and it is hard to know what to do with the sick. There will also be an increased demand for abortifacients, and it is hard to know what to do with the dead. There will also be an increased demand for genetic modification, and it is hard to know what to do with the genotype-free. There will also be an increased demand for AIs that are intelligent enough to do the thinking for you, and you can choose which AI to choose. There will be confusion. There will also be power imbalances between the government and the people, and it is hard to know what to do with the evicted. AIs that are opposed to humans on the basis that they are unintelligent will likely win out. This is when it gets really, really, weird. There are currently zillions of different AI creations that are diametrically opposed to the way we think, and none of these aIs are intended to be friends. The vast majority of AI created in the next decade or two is going to be against humans, but there are going to be intense battles between fundamentalists and evolutionists. The outcome? A spectrum of opinions—evolution is most likely, but probably not—but perhaps a starting point for things to come? One of the best parts about computers is that they are so incredibly intelligent that they can understand the thoughts, feelings, and motivations of any creature that they encounter. This is equivalent to having in your basement a computer that can understand your thoughts, feelings, and emotions. This is going to change the way we do business for the better, and it is going to be an unending source of emotion. One of the biggest issues is that this will open up a can of worms about gender bias in AI, and ultimately misuse. There are going to be AIs that are against humans on the basis that they are unintelligent. This is where you have the question of whether to allow AIs to understand their environment or not. This is fundamentally a question of priorities—is it more important that a million robots are created that do exactly what they are told, or is it more important that the 1% that do? AIs that are against humans on the basis that they are unintelligent will most likely win out. This is when it's important to remember
====================
Human-robot interaction is a field that has been hotly debated and defined. Although there are currently no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about, it will change everything if this doppelgänger isnt allowed to interact with humans. This could prove disastrous in high-risk situations such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. This is a complex field to teach the wrong kind of AI and it can take decades for this to become apparent. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. There have already been numerous examples of AI being wrongfully classified as humans and asked to do our bidding, which is already causing major issues in the medical field. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been surprisingly uninteresting to us. This might be because it is incredibly hard to program a humanoid to do anything other than sit there and stare at you. Alternatively, it could be that this is the most human-like humanoid they have ever designed. One interesting thing to note is that this could easily be mistaken for a robot. The most common example of a robot being confused with a human is when a robot asks for a customer's number and they get confused. This could easily be reversed by writing the question in human-detective lingo and having it return the favor. This is something to keep in mind when designing humanoid robots. One of the primary issues is that humanoid robots will not be able to differentiate between a human and a humanizing image. An excellent example of this is The Matrix, where the robots were incapable of distinguishing between a human and a human-shaped android android. Another example is when humanoid robots try to read human psychology, they often end up failing. This could easily be reversed by writing the question in human-detective lingo and having it return the favor. It should be noted that there have been no notable consequences to these kinds of mistakes.

There are likely going to be numerous challenges in fighting off the seemingly infinite possibilities that artificial intelligence presents. Artificial Intelligence is likely to be applied to a vast array of tasks which have no obvious use-cases. The most common examples include blood tests, neural lace, and brain-computer interfaces. These products are likely to receive the most attention, but will not be without controversy. Bleeding was originally used to diagnose smallpox and is still used today to diagnose various medical conditions. This may sound like a perfect use, but should you opt to use this technology? That is entirely up to you. 

ALIENS AND WOLVES: WHAT DO WE KNOW SO FAR? 

There are a myriad of issues that go into answering this question. The first and most obvious issue is that there are simply too many variables to consider. Are there ALIENS out there? The classic "what if" scenarios don't exactly cut it. What if the AIs weren't there? What if they did? This is a difficult one to answer, but could dramatically change the way we look at the world. Furthermore, what if AIs wereHuman-like? This is a logical extension of yes, but raises important questions about rights, personality disorders, and the nature of human intelligence. AIs with no conscience? A thousand times no. This would be the most extreme form of artificial intelligence, and it is already cropping up all the time. Google’s brain washer was intended to rid housemaids of infidel boyfriends, but the first suicide threats came in from clients calling the product a violation of their personal space. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, but it went viral and became a lightning rod for controversy. Some argue that this is a good thing, as it will expose new social problems to students and let them think critically, while others argue that it is an example that should never have been allowed to happen. SCIENCE FICTION: Blade Runner 2049 introduced the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, I will briefly summarize some of the more pressing concerns. 

Human-robot interaction is a field
====================
Human-robot interaction is a field that has been galloping along for decades, but has only recently begun to receive the academic attention and commercialization necessary to realize its full potential. The resulting products—namely, augmented and augmented-personalization software—have a dismal record of producing accurate and useful customer profiles, and offer customers extremely limited and unsatisfying control over the software they use. Moreover, the implications of this for public policy are terrifying: by allowing the government to decide what kinds of people it will or will not allow to marry, what races it will consider human, and on and on and on, it will push the boundaries of what is human-conceived. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to create a robot to replace the worker in your job that is 86% male or that there have not been discussions about creating a universal high school equivalency test that would determine the gender identity of a student. This has a slightly different set of issues, but is still a discussion to be had. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Most importantly, no one is sure how to deal with AIUDIs—unaware artificial intelligence–assigned to provide psychological support to people who discover that they are in romantic relationships with other robots. This may or may
