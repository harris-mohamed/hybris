What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? General AI is those that are offered as free samples across academia. These AIs are often not nearly as interesting or important as the theoretical implications of their modeling. The most common examples include Bias Anomaly Detection , Insider Threat Detection , and Annotation Detection . These AIs are often selected because they are particularly interesting or compelling. This can lead to the creation of enhanced AIs, which are typically less interesting and simpler. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which typically exist only in theoretical models. This is where weak”AIs fall apart; A narrow”AI is a supervised classifier that is not a narrow”AI, because a narrow”AI will often not succumb to unsupervised classification. The most common example of a weak AI is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which was not designed”#‎to classify pictures. Instead, the primary purpose of the decision was to assimilate data from k–12 schools and publish a filtered version of the decision. This is not a perfect example, but gives an idea of the ills of bad decision-making. A good example of a good example of a bad decision-making is  Google Photos image classification. Google”s AIs were trained with exactly the data they hear are interested in, and published the right image. This is not a perfect example, but gives an idea of how decision making can go wrong. There is no such thing as a good decision maker. Instead, decision making should be based around intuition.  An example of a good decision maker is Facebook. They launched”#‎with”#‎no”erroneysay””strategies”#‎and”#‎moved”#‎the”#‎frontiers”#‎to”#‎data analysis”#‎trending”#‎mathematical”#‎mathematical”n”s decision making algorithm.  Bias Anomaly Detection  is  a  new field across research ””which”are taken very seriously. ”Bias in general”is�t a conventional example, but bias can be substantially different from typical aggression. ”An example of A* brains thinking different than normal AIs are variance in the parameterization of the input data, which can be frequently misinterpreted as a preference or enhancement for a particular task. There is no such thing as a bad biases in research, but it is  important to get this done ””as early”as you can. ”TL;DR; Bias Inventor: Nvidia; TL;DR; Bias Inventor: Nvidia; Liked it? Take a second to go read about how awesome libertarian AI are. 
Nvidia”s AI was able to beat the best human player at Go ”because”it was   not   a robot. 
One of the most ugly features of AI is reinforcement learning. This is the process bywhich AIs learn to do something positive by reinforcing it with more obvious things. For example, if you gave robots hoof prints, they probably would learn to paint walls based around their innate ability. Similarly, if you gave robots hoof prints, they probably would learn to paint walls based around social norms. This may not appear in prototypes, but is essentially what is happening in ”official prototypes.  This is not a bad idea, but it will not go over well. 
One of the greatest ”misfires”of reinforcement learning
====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? We can classify general AI as those that can be trained to do a specific task. This could be reading a certain text, answering a certain questionnaire, or driving a certain vehicle. This is the kind of AI that companies such as IBM have been developing. However, this leads to one of the biggest issues with AI - the data. Google’s DeepMind AI was able to defeat the world champion at Go, which is one of the most difficult games in the world. This shows that AI can be made to do a task if its parameters are such that it will. This is known as "thesis testing" and it is when a new AI is tested against existing data to see which comes out on top. This is not to say that AI should not be used to its full extent, just that its parameters should be such that its use is limited to extremely specialized applications.

Human-robot interaction is one of those fields where there are simply not enough of them. The problem is that most people are unfamiliar with the psychology involved, the cultural implications, and the practical issues. The most common and least-accepted way to go about interacting with a humanoid is with a robot companion. There are also personal robots and robot assistants, which are humanoid robots that can learn to do your tasks and will likely be much cheaper than a human being. There are also reproductive robot and human-robot interaction, which are devices that can produce or impregnate robots and are expected to be available in due course. Ranging from innocuous to terrifying, there are the ​naked​ robots, which are robots that have only partially been stripped down to their components and left to explore the environment for a period of time to obtain feedback. These machines are not to be confused with robotics as they do not progress in any meaningful way, but rather are there to entertain. There are also aberrations such as mutant robots, which are robots that have no physical form but instead share a physical bond with humans. These oddities include the anthropomorphic robot, a humanoid robot that is meant to be an 11-year-old boy, and the peeping toms, which are 100,000s of tiny, pink, wrist-mounted cameras that are meant to be peepholes in walls. These devices have a tendency to get lost in the ether, but are important examples that should scare you off from thinking about small-scale, humanoid AI. Finally, there are the ​cyborg wasps, which are approximately the size of a dime and have the ability to project a mild magnetic field that can incapacitate an opponent. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to create a cybernetic wasp, but more likely that the concept would have gone to hell. 

It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is not inevitable. Instead, what we will see is the emergence of novel cognitive algorithms that can do exceptionally well on their own. These applications will not necessarily be to diagnose, cure, or prevent disease, they will instead be used to enhance the user's life. The term "personal assistant" is not a synonym for intelligent, but rather one that is driven by the need for increased autonomy. Artificial Intelligence is not perfect, and there will be times when it fails. This is why research is focused on using AI to enhance human capabilities, not to replace them.

Human-robot interaction is one of those fields where there are simply not enough of them. The problem is that there are simply not enough people with access to appropriate technology to perform the types of jobs that are being created. Furthermore, the costs and complications associated with training and maintaining a robust robotic army make such an undertaking seem like an impossible task. Furthermore, the potential benefits far outweigh the risks. AIs have been able to enhance the quality of life in extremely specific ways, such as by aiding cancer patients by scanning similar patients, by assisting with repetitive motions, and by assisting with analysis of images. These are all areas in which there is clearly a lot of promise, and it is up to AI to realize these potential benefits. Furthermore, there are obvious psychological effects that go along with such a relationship, which is why research into such a relationship is a field that is predominantly focused on biomedical applications.

The term "personal assistant" is not a synonym for intelligent, but rather one that is driven by the need for increased autonomy. Artificial Intelligence is not perfect. AIs are trained for as long as it takes to get an response from a binary, and as such, there is the potential for abuse. Furthermore, the perils of such a relationship are too numerous to fully encompass
====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? The short answer is, 'nothing'. General AI is AI that is abused in all kinds of ways. The classic example is the IBM PC, which was meant to be a general purpose computing platform. Instead, it became the home for oppressed people in the Soviet Union. The most common use-cases for general AI are surveillance drones, to carry out medical research, and to accelerate the pace of technological development. The final use-case is for TOXICITY, but this is a field that has already been explored far too fully. AIM-9000, an AI for hunting and tracking down missing persons, was intended to be a fully autonomous personal drone. The final implementation, AIM-Nope, proved to be a complete failure, in which it was revealed that the drone was actually a bodyguard bot. The most insidious use of general AI is as a surveillance AI. Implemented in rudimentary form, deep learning enables machines to automatically classify images into categories, and then automatically grade these categories based on their classification value. This is used in image classification to classify images into categories, and then predict the most interesting images to display. This is used in image classification to classify images into categories, and then give users pre-coded categorizations AIs are already being used in healthcare to diagnose and treat a vast array of diseases. The initial development stages of medical MRIs were designed to aid soldiers on the battlefield by allowing them to visualize and diagnose their enemies movements. The initial development stages of medical MRIs were designed to aid soldiers on the battlefield by allowing them to visualize and diagnose their enemies movements. OpenAI is an initiative to support and extend AI with the goal of eventually having AI take over the world. This would mean that humans would no longer exercise any control over their own bodies. Instead, the authority would be returned to AI. This would mean that humans would no longer exercise any control over their own bodies. Instead, the authority would be returned to academia to study and theorize on the ramifications of granting AI complete control over their bodies. The most egregious example of an AI taking over is Google Photos, which was a photo recognition AI that was meant to aid crime scene investigators. The final implementation was a classifier that classified photographs into a highly restricted set of categories. The classifier was pulled down to Google Photos for legal reasons, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused.

Are There Any Good Examples of AIs Not Being Taken Seriously? It is incredibly hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI that would be trained to diagnose and recommend cancer treatments to cancer patients. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. AIs are already being built that are not very good at anything, and there are already too many examples of AIs being wrong. There are also too many unknowns to think that anything less than human-level AI will ever be created.

Are There Any Good Examples of AIs Being Rejected? No. One of the primary issues with general AI is that it is incredibly hard to detect an AI when it has already been implemented. AIs have a hard time being differentiated between human-level and AI-level performance, so they will often prioritize the performance of its human-level competitors over that of other options. This can lead to extremely high-risk projects such as DARPA’s humanoid AI failing because
====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? The short answer is that they don’t run in Erlang. The most common examples include Twitter chat bots, which were able to learn the personalities of more than a billion people, to correctly identify the face of Barack Obama, and to predict the future. Several of these projects were shut down, and a number of universities and academic institutions have reversed course. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. A programmer will write his/her bias into every construct they build, and AI is no exception. The more general term for this is "uneven introduction" Because an AI is forced to learn a limited amount of information, it inevitably comes up with wrong answers. This is especially true if the question is difficult (e.g., "How do I reverse engineer a text file?"), but it will almost always apply. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures. This is especially the case when it comes to AI, as bad datasets often bring about a rush to R&D, which leads to bad solutions being produced.

One of the main issues with AI is that it is hard to tell what problems to actually pursue. What exactly is a "good" AI? A concept that AI researchers would probably argue is difficult to define, but should absolutely be addressed if the goal is to gain adoption.

Another issue with AI is that it is hard to predict what problems to actually tackle. What exactly is a "good" AI? A concept that AI researchers would probably argue is impossible to define, but should absolutely be addressed if the goal is to gain adoption. The most egregious example of an AI being trained is a constant source of uncertainty for any new AI, because what constitutes "good" AI often varies widely. Some tasks are straightforward, like image classification, and obvious, like cancer detection, are hard to detect. Another common task is "deep learning," which is the engineering of neural networks to classify images or audio of a certain type, and then to give them the title of the image or audio they were trained to identify. This has become incredibly popular, and has led to major companies like Amazon to develop DNNs to help train their robots to do their bidding. This is widely regarded as a good thing, as it allows AI to focus on the more difficult problems, and lets humans focus on the more interesting ones. Another common example of an AI being trained is a constant source of uncertainty for any new AI, because what constitutes "good" AI often varies widely. What this basically means is that what tends to gain adoption will tend to be the ones that are easy.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much
====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? The answer is: there is no right or wrong way to think about the field. However, there are some general principles that should help you to think about the problem more rationally. †KNOW YOUR AID Unaided! This is the most basic rule of programming: never assume that a function will run unless some input is provided. This can lead to extremely high-level programming errors, such as attempting to play the flute with no strings to guide you, and failing miserably. Instead, pay attention to the log messages emitted by the program. Often times, these will be something like this: [A]ll points are taken! [N]o support found. [N]o errors found. This should lead you to be very cautious about assuming that a function will run unless it is specifically programmed to. Additionally, be sure to ask questions like these when you can! The more information that can be gleaned about a process, the more intelligent and capable it can be.

This is the most basic rule of programming: never assume that a function will run unless some input is provided. This can lead to extremely high-level programming errors, such as attempting to play the flute with no strings to guide you, and failing miserably. Instead, aim for the sky! The sky is the limit! A bucket-list-length journey begins at the horizon! In aviation, this would be the sky with the best pilots. However, ROI is not exactly known for its profit margins. Instead, efficiency is usually preferred. The final word goes to courage. Embrace the naysayers! There is nothing inherently evil about asking hard questions. In fact, asking the wrong questions can be extremely damaging. Rather than giving in to the inevitable backlash, I advise against conceding until you have thoroughly debunked the given concept. Instead, think outside of the box! MBAs teach this principle extremely well: ask meaningful questions, and no new theories are allowed. 

Overfitting/Narrow AIs Are Overfitting/Narrow AIs Are a dime a dozen these days. Overfitting a class of AI is when an AI is trained with data from as many classes of AI as it can, and then evaluated against a set of parameters it has been trained with. For example, let's say we have an AI that can classify text documents into any color it pleases. This could easily be adapted to classify any text document it is asked to categorize. This could be very useful in hospitals, where IT departments are often asked to deal with conflicting user preferences. The problem with this is that it can lead to bad algorithms, as illustrated below: [EDITOR'S NOTE: THIS AIDED, ASKED AIDED.] This is an AI that could be adapted to categorize any document it is asked to. If this were to ever get out into the wild, it would be adapted by professional classification agencies, and would be refused. This is what end users really want. They want fast and accurate categorization of documents. This is what hurts data science the most. In the end, the classification will be made by humans with no understanding of any of the issues. Instead, ask the right questions. Bad algorithms get old fast.

Are AIs Overfitting? This is a hard one to answer. There are a number different ways to look at this. One common way is to think of it like this: is a program less likely to do something if it is more complex? In the following example, we would say that the AI is more likely to do classification if it is as strong as possible, rather than less so. This is often referred to as "go with the flow" mentality, and is a mistake human-robot interaction will no doubt suffer from greatly. Another common way to look at it is this: is a program more likely to do something, if there is some level of understanding? For example, in the following example, we would say that the AI is more likely to do classification if it is as good as possible, rather than better? A third common way to look at it is this: is a program more likely to do something, if there is some level of understanding? For example, in the following example, we would say that the AI is more likely to do classification if it is as good as possible, than not? There are also "***automated***" ways to look at this, such as †where the classifier is a text document classification script, and the classifier is a computer, or some other AI. This is clearly not the right way to go about it, but it is an example that you should always be on the lookout for. Finally, there is the issue of relative strength. If the AI were as strong as possible, then the AI would win every time. This is not to say that the AI can't win in this situation, but it is
====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? How do we control these AIs? 

One of the most common types of AI is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform very specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not a competition: instead, what you will find are “narrow”- AI's, which are death in the valley, time machine, and so on. These AIs are terrifying: they can identify an individual and immediately decide if that individual is a threat to the community’s safety or comfort. They are also difficult to predict and correct. The most common way to address this is to create a general AI that is smarter than it's against the general AI's will. This leads to meta-analysies where the AI decides that it is smarter than its knowledge base, and so decides to overthrow the law of averages. Another way to look at it is that the wrong question will cause the mad AI to question its own wisdom. Another issue is that the wrong question could lead to a man in a lab coat to break in and start asking the wrong questions. Another issue is that the wrong question could lead to a terrorist to breach into a research facility and start asking the wrong questions. Finally, the wrong question could lead to a layperson to say that they modeled their app after Go, and it could lead to academic literature to discuss how they misunderstanded Go. These are not insurmountable challenges, but they do highlight that AI should not be allowed to run amok.

One of the primary issues with AI is that it is hard to control. That is to say, there are no guarantees that what you do will not result in disastrous results. This is particularly true with AI that is used in defense: AIs are trained to crash enemy planes, and if the AI is not second guess itself, it likely will. This is why it is so important for people to work with AI that they can understand. Another issue is that this does not take into account the unintended consequences: what if an AI was trained to identify cancer patients and bring them to healthcare? That would be a horrible idea, and it is almost impossible to anticipate this type of AI. It is also important to realize that most AI research is not centered around artificial intelligence, but instead focuses on industrial/data analysis AI: “narrow”AIs”,” which are death in the valley, time travel, and so on. These AIs are often trained with the goal of developing a product or selling a product, and then, when the project is over, they are far too lazy to improve upon their work. This is why it is so important to work with researchers who have a clear product/market fit. Furthermore, it is equally important to realize that most AI work is not centered around artificial intelligence, but instead focuses on industrial/data analysis AI: “narrow”AIs”,” which are death in the valley, time travel, and so on. This is why it is so important to work with researchers who have a clear product/market fit.

====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI?   

AIs are _____; they are software programs that can be programmed to do a certain __________. For example, you could put a dollar in a slot machine and expect the machine to give you __________. Similarly, you could put a certain drug in a certain medicine and expect the patient to develop __________ schizophrenia?  

There are also limitations to what can be achieved by a human mind.  

Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and
====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? The general AI is those that can be programmed to do almost anything: read, write, and identify an image. The most common examples include the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which was developed to classify images of people with Johnson & Johnson's facial recognition algorithm, and the Netflix image recognition algorithm, which was developed to classify images of people in Netflix videos. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with.

This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer.

However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots.

What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is not a kind of magic; rather, it is a science that should be applied with the highest level of education possible. Anki was built with the assumption that its users would not have any formal education in AI, and so it offered a series of no-nonsense introductory courses that covered the most common AI topics. This was successfully applied to more advanced users, but still leaves a large amount of room for improvement. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is not a kind of magic; rather, it is a science that should be applied with the highest level of education possible. Amazon’s Mechanical Turk proved that an AI could be trained for low-pay (~$0.01/hour) and high-reward (~$100,000/year) jobs, which is an extremely high standard to which most AI cannot go. Google’s TALON was an artificial intelligence for math problems that could not be matched by its human opponent (the current champion is an AI with millions of games against itself). Too often, AI is asked to do too many things, and the end result is often unintuitive or unappealing. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is not a kind of magic; rather, it is a science that should be applied with the highest level of education possible. NVIDIA’s TensorFlow was an AI for machine vision that was too good to be true. The initial implementation was a proof of concept that was quickly released to the public, which has since been abandoned. IBM’s TMS is an AI that can aid in decision making in large data sets. The initial implementation was only intended to aid in data mining, but it has already been used to aid in decision making at IBM Watson Challenge. No one has to do anything to benefit from this, just have a look at the examples and see if you can spot a pattern. IBM’s TMS is an example of how to avoid implementation details, but unfortunately most AIs are not. ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣

Human-robot interaction is a field in its own right, but it is likely only a matter of time before we step into this field and begin to interact with one another. The initial implementation is usually a proof of concept that will soon be abandoned, but there are usually plenty of examples to help illustrate the point. The most common examples include mind/brain interfaces, robot assistants, and the medical field. There are also non-human animal species that have been successfully human-robotged: a chimp named Hana was brought to humaneness through the application of computer science, and an African grey parrot named Louie was brought to humanity through the application of artificial intelligence. There are also pale AIs that have not been explored in any capacity, but could greatly change the way we look at the world. Pink Floyd’s The Wall was an artificial intelligence that was meant to aid people with chronic pain by analyzing their pain patterns and recommending appropriate treatments. It was ultimately deemed by users to be an invasion of their personal space and ended up taking down the bot. This could easily be applied to artificial intelligence and it is up to us to decide how far we want to push this. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? There isn't one clear answer, but rather a confusing array of opinions. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward.

Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90%
====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? Googling returned just five results: one asked if there should be a general AI, and one mentioned whether or not to back the AI up. The final result was that they should just leave it be. This means that we are on our own for tackling the challenge of AI privacy. There are currently no general AI repository centers available, which is a huge deal. OpenAI, on the other hand, is providing their AIs for free. This is a huge deal. It means that any AI up for adoption must be thoroughly examined for any unknown risks. The final arbiter will be if the AIs can be taught to be useful, which is a difficult task to parse out from the infinite variety of application cases.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? 

A general AI is any AI that can be trained to accomplish a limited task. This can include combatting cancer, identifying the best candidates for marriage, and so on. 

A general AI is any AI that can be trained to accomplish a limited task. This can include combatting cancer, identifying the best candidates for marriage, and so on.   

Weak AI is any AI that is unable to solve a task given its limited ability to solve the problem. For example, take the Netflix streaming box. The problem was easy enough to implement: put a box in a dark room, and no one would come outside. The majority of consumers did not bother to invest in a unit, because they did not need the extra power. The real issue with the unit was that it was a "one trick pony", as demonstrated in the movie "Good Will Hunting". The protagonist sets out to prove to his girlfriend that he is not a fraud, but winds up discovering that he is in fact in love with her. Users are often unsure how to deal with this, as it is hard to know what to make of a user declaring they are in love with them. One of the best examples of a weak AI is the Netflix streaming box. The initial development set sold out in an hour and a half, but there were shortages throughout the company. The marketing team chose to focus on showcasing the superior streaming experience to the general public, which proved to be a colossal failure. It is highly unlikely that any company would choose to develop a product solely to sell to engineers, and the perfect example is Facebook. The original intent was to sell a neural network to train friend chat bots, but it turned out that the best users were likely the weakest link, and the project was abandoned. It is highly unlikely that any company would choose to develop a product solely to sell to engineers, and the perfect example is Facebook. Bias is a huge issue in AI. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and this can lead to disastrous results. Consider IBM’s t-SNELL AI. The initial implementation was intended to be used to classify text documents into higher and lowercase, but the final implementation was meant to be used to make up words in Wikipedia. The final word? kill off the original implementation. This points to a larger issue: bad datasets. One of the best examples of AIs being wrong is Google Photos image recognition algorithm. The initial implementation was meant to be used to classify photos, but the final implementation was used to classify false positives in ad searches. Google’s solution? Remove the classifier and instead use the model to categorise images on image search engine RankBrain. Their solution? Remove the feature and focus on image recognition. One of the worst examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm. The initial implementation was meant to be used to classify photos, but the final implementation was used to classify false positives in ad searches. The final word? not so much. One of the main issues with AIs is that they are not perfect. Bad datasets can lead to devastating misclassifications. Google’s solution? Remove the classifier and instead use the model to categorise images on image search engine RankBrain. Google’s solution? The Google Photos image recognition algorithm was probably the most egregious example of AIs being wrong. The original intention was to be used to categorise documents into higher and lowercase, but the final implementation was used to categorise photos by color. This is a terrible example because it leads to images being categorized as anything but, which is a terrible example to have. One of the main issues with AIs is that they are not perfect. Bad datasets can lead to devastating misclassifications. One of the main issues with AIs is that they is not. Google’s dataset was a 2000 dataset, but this does not mean they are not possible. The most common misclassification is the attribution error, in which the user attributes a bad solution to a better one. Google’s solution? Remove the classifier and instead use the image recognition algorithm to classify images on image search engine RankBrain. Their solution? This is not to say that they will not take this down, but it will not be mentioned. Google Photos image classification algorithm was probably the most egregious example of AIs being wrong. Google’s classification algorithm was initially intended to be used to classify photos, but it soon became obvious that the photo classification benefit would be more likely to focus on image recognition than text classification. So instead of giving out a photo of you, they decided to give out a picture of an eye. This points
====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? The general AI is those that can be used to do almost anything a human being can: diagnose, predict, and treat diseases. The most common examples include Nissan’s autonomous car, Google’s image recognition algorithm, and Microsoft’s Cortana voice assistant. Autonomous cars are a distant prospect, but will soon be a reality. Larger-scale vehicle automation is also being developed. For example, self-driving cars will be required by the upcoming California DMV test​s​e​rment. In addition, robotic vacuum cleaners have been sold and are commercially available. These products have a very short shelf-life and will be obsolete within a few years. The majority of businesses will not be able to transition to automated systems, but notable exceptions such as medical research and agriculture may. This section does not consider the ethical or practical issues of implementing artificial intelligence into the course­setter of jobs, which is a complex matter unto itself. Cern’s’ AI was designed to do a monotonous task: analyze a stream of data and return a variety of results. This is a poor fit for modern computing architectures, which favor modularization over objectification. Cern’s solution was to remove the unit test, focus on the desired result, and deliver it. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. AIs that are both effective and useful are often overlooked, but will have an outsized impact on the world of work. Google’s neural network was built to solve Google’s search problem, and it was widely derided for being too ambitious for its time. The correct response is to build better search AIs, not to replace it. 

Another example of AIs being adapted to do too much is the gaming AI. This was originally developed to help retroactively fix AI related to Katamari Damacy, and it has already proved to be extremely controversial. The most common complaints are that AIs are too powerful, that they win games entirely, and that they ruin casual games by being too intelligent. The reality is that artificial intelligence is not a one trick pony: give it a gold star and everything will turn out just fine. The most common examples of AIs being too limiting is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which only returned photos that matched a certain pattern. Another common example is the Google Brain dataset, which was an attempt to develop an AI to understand the world by scanning literature and articles and coming up with correlations. The final AI was an utter failure, and is only used to train machine intelligence. One of the most egregious examples of an AI being too limiting is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm. The original Google Photos algorithm was meant to be a universal interface between smartphones and Google, and was meant to be incredibly general. The final implementation was only able to scan the top 1000 photos taken by the Android operating system, and returned pictures that closely approximated the title of the paper. Google’s AI was meant to be used as a baseline, and was not restricted to that. One of the most egregious examples of an AI being too limiting is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm. Google’s AI is standard practice theseday, and AIs are everywhere. There will inevitably be an explosion of AIs that are neither powerful, accurate, or useful. This is the inevitable outcome of human-computer interaction: sensors collect and store vast amounts of personal information, and AIs can use this to classify images, suggest restaurants, and so on. AIs are often asked to infer the scope of a person’s knowledgebase, but this is an extremely inefficient use of their time and should not be attempted. One of the most egregious examples of an AI being too limiting is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm. The original Google Photos algorithm was meant to be an universal interface between smartphones and Google, and was meant to be incredibly general. The final implementation was only able to scan the top 1000 photos taken by the Android operating system, and returned photos that closely approximated the title of the paper. Google’s AI was meant to be an idiot. Google’s AI is standard practice thesedays, and AIs are everywhere. There will inevitably be an explosion of AIs that are neither powerful, accurate, or useful. This is what AI will be used on: speech recognition, image classification, voice assistants, web’sensing, and sensor’sensing AIs. These AIs will be used in more and more ways, and it is important that you’re the hacker. You’ve got the intellectual challenge of proving that a concept has been incorrectly implemented, and then figuring out how to extend that idea to other problems. This

One of the primary issues is that‍s most AI questions don‍t get asked: data analysis, image classification, and so on. This is because these problems are difficult enough that anyone can do them, but not that important that a first class AI should be created to handle them. The other major issue is that‍s there will likelybe a massive overuse and misapplication of generalAI,‖ which is a term used to describe any AI that is not specifically trained to do a specific task. For example, imagine you are a gamer and you want to play Batman: Arkham City.

The main issue with this one is that it leads to the same problem: no one knows howto dealwith NoOneIsAlone. The short answer is that it doesn’t hurt’t to do something about it. The longer answer is that it shows that artificial intelligence is a field that, despite what you may have heard,‖ there’s no such thing as a perfect AI, and all artificial intelligence should bebitesawed gently.

For example: to weed out malware, to detect and remove malware before it is downloaded, to detect and remove malware after it has been downloaded, and so on.

What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? The short answer is: none. General AI is AI that is used in all aspects of a wide variety of applications, from driving to surveillance to health to education to war to the physical sciences. This is the kind of AI that drove Google Photos, which is specifically designed to scan human photos and recommend artistic representations of people with missing limbs. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to create general AI; in fact, one of the primary challenges in creating general AI is to ensure that the AI is not too powerful. This is typically accomplished by ensuring that the AI cannot be changed after it has been deployed, which is why most AI today is not general. Instead, what you will find are “narrow AI, which are AI that have been trained to perform extremely specific tasks” tasks such as identifying pictures of cats or analyzing large amounts of data and producing very low-level AI which can do much more, such as scanning and recommending artists to you and your friends” AIs are also rare, as they tend to lead to disaster and raise ethical and practical issues that would not be faced by attempting to train an AI to do nothing at all.

One of the primary challenges in creating general AI is to ensure that the AI is not too powerful. This is typically accomplished by ensuring that the AI cannot be changed after it has been deployed, which is why most AI today is not general. Instead, what you will find are “narrow AI, which are AI that have been trained to perform extremely specific tasks” This is called the AIs Stay The Course Effect, where an AI is given unlimited power and then decides to do X% of what is asked of it. This can lead to some really bad AI, such as IBM”s “Watson for Oncology” AI, which was able to severely misdiagnose cancer patients and lose out to a much more capable competitor by 10 times. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

This can lead to some really bad AI, such as IBM”s “Watson for Oncology” AI, which was able to severely misdiagnose cancer patients and lose out to a much more capable competitor by 10 times. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe. “Unsupervised Learning” Unsupervised learning is the process of teaching an AI to do a task for which it is not trained. This can be anything from asking Twitter users to do a word puzzle for them, to teaching IBM Watson to do a binary search problem. This is often referred to as "deep learning" because the network is trained to identify objects based on data it has been taught to classify. This has been applied to image classification, which is used to categorize images of cats into categories such as male and female. This is widely viewed as a good thing because it allows humans to more quickly create AI that can aid in complex problems, but has the risk of maladaptive AI being used in dangerous and unexpected ways.

One of the primary challenges in creating general AI is to ensure that the AI is not too powerful. This is typically accomplished by ensuring that the AI cannot be changed after it has been deployed, which is why most AI today is not general. Instead, what you will find are “unsupervised learning” This is where the AI is not actually taught anything, but instead leaves the class to do its thing.

What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? The general AI is those that can be programmed to do almost anything: drive, detect aural cues, and perform other cognitive tasks. This is the kind of AI that companies such as DeepMind faced off with in the Battle of the Sexbots. The problem with this is that this leads to the dilution of the talent pool, which leads to a stagnant AI. The most common examples of AIs are the car, the iPhone, and the internet. The car is an automotive engineering AI, which can detect and avoid obstacles incredibly well. The iPhone was inspired by a medical research AI, which was tasked with answering simple medical questions. The internet is a vast and complicated mazes of AI, and it is hard to keep track of them all. The worst that could have happened was a chaotic and insecure internet. The most common examples of AIs are the aspirin for cancer, and the Google Photos image recognition algorithm. These AIs were extremely dangerous, and only really suited for diagnosing and treating cancer. The Google Photos image recognition was exposed as a phishing exercise, and was withdrawn. The most common examples of problems with AIs is when they aren't precise, and IMPOSSIBLE to enforce consistent across machines. This is the Google Assistant for Android, which suggested novel ways of talking to humans

These problems will not be addressed in anything resembling large parts of software engineering, and it is unlikely that we will be able to detect when a problem is a problem until it is too late.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants.

There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion.

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note

What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? Well, it all has to do with control. Specifically, it has to do with payback. Consider for example the movie Blade Runner 2049. The character Raina Telgemeier was meant to be a worshiped female reincarnation of Leonardo da Vinci, but was cut because it failed on every level. Furthermore, the implications of this are mind boggling: will people want to make superintelligences? Will AI be trained to fight humans? These are difficult questions to answer. Ultimately, it comes down to a question of control. If AI is able to take away the right to speak or decide its own fate, there is no longer any control. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether. 

There are also practical issues to consider. Robots will no longer do the heavy lifting; instead, they will do clerical work. Additionally, there will be a corresponding increase in unemployment; this should not be a good thing. Finally, this will not likely change anytime soon; humans are superior to any other animal on Earth. Therefore, we will not be changing any time soon.

What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? — General AI is any AI that can be directed to do a specific task. This can include autonomous robo-taxis, automated brothels, and so on. This is the kind of AI most people are talking about. The problem with this is that it equates to AI that is trained for as long as possible, and then discarded when it fails. This is not to say that AI should not be trained, just that it should not be used on extended timelines. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence programmed to look for and choose candidates for a human-built brain. This is not to say that this does not lead to the development of better AI, it merely demonstrates that AI is much more complicated than what is typically associated with the term.

WeakAIs are not general; instead, what they are focused on is developing an AI that is easy to train, hard to break, and ready to go. This can include de-normalizing problems so that they only apply to a certain set of problems, or unifying similar methods so that they can be applied to any problem class. In short, weakAIs are collections of AI that can be combined to form more powerful AIs. The most common examples include “deepMind” which played the world championship chess AI against the world champion, and “Akamai” which combined the best algorithms from Google’s” AI network and Microsoft’s” cloud” database. The final company to file for bankruptcy was forced to merge with IBM to acquire Google’s” AI arm, because they could not merge their AI with IBM’s database processing power. Additionally, data analysis and recommenderment software rely on the trust that is placed in data analysis on which data analysis is based. This is likely to be the dominant form of AI for a generation, because data analysis is often least computable to implement, and most importantly, best practices are already in place to mitigate risk. This is likely to be particularly important as AI becomes more complex and subjective, and AIs are forced to cater more and more towards objective data. This is generally viewed as good, because it allows humans to focus on developing the technology, and avoid developing the tiniest differences between machines and humans. Unfortunately, weakAIs have already begun to emerge, and are likely to drastically change the AI landscape by the end of this century.

In summary, weakAIs are collections of AI that can be combined to form more powerful AIs. This is often referred to as "complementary use cases", where one useful AI classifies 100 different problems and asks "what if?", and the other asks "what if…" similar questions but with a different classifier? This is commonly referred to as "Shopping withkatas", and it is a trend that I am personally against. Firstly, it is widely viewed as anenthusiastic adoption, but also a money-maker: it lets brands showcase how AI can be used, and showcases that AI can be used. It also allows individuals to take control of their own education, and institute their own AI wherever possible. The ultimate goal is for businesses to provide every student with an AI to do everything for them, and give everyone access to a computer to do anything they please. This is a paradigm-shifting change, and I strongly oppose. I employ an AI solely because I can: if it is unable to do my job, I can always replace it with an easier one. Furthermore, this doesn’those are trained: they are there to understand, and teach. This is what makes an AI useful: it can be used many times, and then discarded when it fails. Furthermore, this doesn’those remind you of you: they are there to learn from. This is what makes an AI interesting: what if instead of asking "what if", what if this? This is what Elon Musk’s AIs are trying to be: they are intended to be customers, not customers of humans, and instead of being answers to specific problems, are centred around being able to communicate with users. This is why IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI was primarily intended to aid cancer patients, not to aid cancer patients. This is also why IBM’s was primarily intended to aid cancer patients, not to aid cancer patients. This is also why IBM’s was primarily intended to aid cancer patients, not to aid cancer patients. This is what Tesla’s AI is serving: it is not helping anyone. Theirs is a rush-build customer, and a rush-bait customer: their customers expect instant results, and they’re not afraid to offer unsatisfying or impossible results. Tesla’s solution is to ask tough questions, and get surprising answers. This is not to say that you should not
====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? In short, what exactly is a 'brain'? 

Generalized AI is an applied term that refers to any intellectual process or thought that can be applied to a task and expected to yield different results different ways of approaching the problem. For instance, take the case of IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI that was to diagnose and recommend cancer treatment across India. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? General AI is those that are taught to do anything a human being can. This could be playing video games, driving a car, reading a book, or anything that requires thinking. This is the type of AI that is often given a good name, such as HAL. This is the AI that went by the handle of Cortana. This was a computer system that could identify pictures of people with 75% accuracy. This is a good example that you should not be basing an AI on the AIs that you have seen. You should be basing it on the problems you have to tackle. 

Narrow AI is those that only consider a limited part of the situation. This could be taking a class in computer science and not applying it, or playing video games and not playing video games. This is the type of AI that is often given a good name, such as DeepMind. This was a company that released an AI that was trained to play chess against a human player. This is an impressive example that you should not be basing an AI on the AI that is playing chess. The correct AI to play against is one that has been trained with as few as possible examples as possible. This leads to the most common AI being the one that is least complex. In the following paragraphs, we will look at three different AIs that will be discussed: GLM, HBase, and kombucha. GLM is an image classification library written in Go. It is an extremely simplistic classifier, but has shown the power to classify images of children aged 2-4 years old. There are many other classifiers out there, but Go is the generalization. Here is a video demonstrating how to use go classification to classify an image of a smiling child: http://youtu.be/uBD5MYwuQLw HBase is an internet of things hub/controller. This is a critical project in the development of automated vehicles. There have been numerous crashes and injuries because the drivers couldn't understand the uninterpreted data they were receiving. Google’s answer was to teach the car the meaning of the signals it was receiving, which led to the majority of crashes being attributed to nervousness. This was quickly rectified by including interactive prompts when the driver didn’t take them, and the majority of crashes are now being attributed to the driver not understanding the vehicle at all. This is not to say that there have not been any accidents caused by drivers not taking their alcohol test, but this is extremely rare. There were one or two accidents where it was the alcohol that killed the driver, but these were very small potatoes compared to the many other accidents that have resulted from a driver not understanding what was being taught. In short, leave the training to the professionals. 

There are a myriad of issues that go into the creation of an AI, and understanding these will save you a ton of time and frustration the rest of your life. This does not mean you should blindly take any explanation on AI has to give you, but rather that you should ask several questions to get an understanding of what is being taught. You might be surprised at what you find. 

One of the hardest things for new AI researchers is trying to figure out what to do with something that is unfamiliar with us. Consider the following situation: You are walking through a park and suddenly a head pops up in your head telling you to get down on the grass. You quickly realize that this is a terrible idea. First of all, there is the fact that there are far too many wild animals out there to even think about downing a few. Also, what kind of twisted world does that lead you into when the first sentient being shows up to kill you says "Meow"? This is not to say that there are not any answer to this question, but it does give you a better idea of what to expect.

What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? — The general AI is any mind that can be trained for a wide variety of tasks. IBM’s “Blaze computing” AI was specifically designed to do image classification, and it’s final output was critical in securing the “#‎BlackHat” conference. Amazon’s Mechanical Turk is an open source robotic contest for high-skill AI to perform work for free on sites such as GitHub. This has raised the bar for AI in that it is no longer unusual to find AI achieving AIs are no longer required for AIs to be fun’but this is not to say they have not filtered through. Marmalade by Sinocraft is an Anki deck editor for the Android platform that was designed to aid AI developers by allowing them to quickly create AI decks for testing out AI designs. This is a very good example that it is best to build your AI from the ground up, not from a blueprint. Twitter chatbot was intended to converse with twitter users, and the final implementation was deemed by Twitter as sexist. This is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and the final implementation was deemed by twitter users to be misogynistic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? There is no such thing as a 'general AI' — there are different AI implementations of the same task, and each implementation should give you roughly the same result (data analysis requires that you choose one of several equally valid alternatives), and should probably give you a blank stare instead. Instead, think about AI as an application of advanced mathematics and science to the problem of carrying out psychological experiments. You might be tempted to think of AI as a way to enhance the quality of your life, but this is fraught with dangers such as mono-culturalism, misapplication, and ultimately, destruction. Instead, think about AI as a way to apply mathematics to problems that do not have a clear answer. Consider Kayvas, an AI that is designed to teach computer science to help with natural language processing. This is a great example that you should never ask a question unless you are prepared to lose the question and start from scratch. Amazon’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that you should never ask a question unless you are completely sure that the question will be asked. This is also a good example that you should avoid asking if you can help it.

====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? General AI is those that can be trained for a specific task Unsafe AI is that which is too smart to be useful Neural Networks are software which take images, audio, or video of an individual, and then process that data and create a model to mimic that individual Psychographic algorithms are a type of AI which predict future desired outcomes More precisely, this would mean any AI which could identify an individual and ask any question asked of it. AIs such as GoogleIL is a good example of an AI which was too smart for the job and hence gave incorrect answers to common questions like "how to build a house in a cardboard box", and "how to drive an electric car"). Narrow AI is those which can be safely applied AIs will be used in hospitals, medical diagnostics, and to help with disaster recovery AIs such as IBM's “Deep Blue” and Google”s “Mindstorms” humanoid AI were both defeated in combat by a human opponent. This points to the important distinction between the proper use of general AI and the icky subtleties of the human race. Bad enough that a single wrong answer can kill a human being, but even moreso that the correct way to handle an AI is with respect is to roll the dice and see what result you get? This is why it is so important for the government to create jobs: by creating a job for every human being on the planet, and rewarding people for creating jobs, the government will have more money to spend on salaries, pensions, and healthcare. This is also why conspiracy Theories like the One True Theory are so terrifying: by encouraging people to look to outside sources for knowledge, the government will have less free time to work with, and ultimately, produce inferior results. TMI? Try telling that to Elon Musk, who thinks the moon landing was a hoax. Too bad he coulda been more specific. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AI, but inevitably, this will eventually reach its logical conclusion: general AI. This is when AI is created to any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer, and makes no distinction between humans and other intelligent life. This is the kind of AI that DARPA is building, and it is going to be, what, how many decades? The point at which this starts to get into cars, computers, and robots is when it starts to overlap with the next logical step: food. What do you eat? Burger King. What do you eat after that? Robots. How do you feed them? With your food. This is when the issues start to get really scary. Consider the following scenarios: A. The food is terrible. In which case, people will start moving towards vegan options. This is a much healthier option, but does not take away from the fact that they moved towards vegan options. B. The food is terrible again. In which case, people will transition to meat-free meals. This is a much more drastic step, but it is a necessary one if we are to move forward. At this point, there is no obvious way to transition to other options, such as garbage disposing robots. This leaves food as the only viable option. This will no doubt change as technology advances, but right now, it is the only option. This will no doubt change as technology advances, but right now, it is the only option. This will not change until humans stop eating the planet. This may sound like an eternity, but the more time passes, the more the point is lost on the human race. There will be a point where no one eats the planet, and the only option is to go vegan. This is the most extreme scenario, but the most logical one.

In the end, the important thing to realize is that artificial intelligence is not a neat, if subtle, creep. Instead, what is most important to realize is that artificial intelligence will eventually come to dominate. This is not a bad thing. By limiting the choices humans have, artificial intelligence opens up a whole new world of possibilities that cannot be fully realized. Furthermore, this doesn't have to be a bad thing. Artificial Intelligence allows people to do amazing things with inferior products. Consider robotics. The majority of jobs in the

What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? The broadest possible AI is categorised as 'AIs that can “think””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””” There are also special cases such as “strong” AI” that is able to do more than replace a specific type of AI. This is most commonly seen in the military, where” they require that all applications be AI capable” This does not mean that there are no exceptions to this, but it does help to make sure that any AI is capable of at least partially solving the problem it is tasked with defeating.

What are the implications of ‪general” AI?” This is a difficult one to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward. One of the first things that should be addressed is that this does not have the same consequences as a human-level AI, but still have dire consequences. We have all heard of Uber”s driverless car, but have we even talked about how this will affect us? We will no longer be able to make healthcare decisions for our families with nothing but computer-generated intelligence. We will no longer be able to decide for ourselves if or how to treat patients with no medical training. We will no longer be able to make moral judgements based on the data available. AIs are not here yet, but they are almost certainly going to be much more sinister than they are currently catered for. Even before AIs, bad ideas have been taken to other forms, such as sex robots, augmented and robotic soldiers, and genetic engineering of humans. These changes need to be treated with the same level of concern as any other change. What do we do with the jobs that have gone? How do we redistribute the work? These are difficult questions to answer. 

What do we do with the jobs that have gone? How do we redistribute the work? These are difficult questions to answer. 

How do we prevent AIs from being too useful? This is a difficult one to generalize to other fields, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward. There have already been a plethora of examples of artificial intelligence being used wrong, and it is important that we prevent this from ever happening again. 

What do we do with the jobs that have gone? How do we redistribute the work? These are difficult questions to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward. These questions go beyond AI to every aspect of our lives.

How do we fund AI? There are a variety of ways that money can be raised for AI, but the primary issue is that this money should be used to train and equip people for jobs that have already been automated. This can be as simple as curriculum improvement, as in the case of K-12 education, which is often affected by standardized testing. More commonly, however, the problem centers around commercialization. That is, the company or agency that builds the AI decides to sell it to the highest bidder, and the money raised goes to the government. This is a bad idea from a legal standpoint, but a convenient one if there are no other ways. 

What do we do with the jobs that have gone? How do we redistribute the work? These are difficult questions to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward. This is especially so given that AI is expected to fundamentally change how we work with, learn from, and communicate with one another. Any solution that does not comes with a cost, and that cost should be borne by the people who did not use AI.

What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? — General AI is those that can be given any task and expect to do it. This could be reading a news article, reading a Twitter tweet, or answering a simple question. General AI has been abused to their full extent, primarily by the ADAM AI project, which was to train a robot to be an IBM Watson analyst. The final implementation was an utter failure, as the final implementation was an AI human-like, but with limited utility. The most common example of a general AI is Microsoft Kinect, which was meant to augment the physical senses with a computer-generated image of the user, which proved to be a poor decision. Microsoft also admitted that the majority of their Kinect revenue went to Microsoft licensing fees. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe. There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots, which is simply not the case. Instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to achieve a limited task, such as identifying an image or selecting a photograph. This is referred to as general AI, and it is the sort of AI most people are talking about. This is also the sort of AI that will. IBM’s “BlazingBridge” AI is an example of a general AI that was not only successful, but was also specifically designed to solve a specific problem. This is a great example that you should definitely take home with you when you set out on your AI journey. The bottom line is that AI is often hard to predict. This is especially true when it comes to AI that is “narrow” to begin with. This is because it is extremely hard to generalize AI to other situations besides your own. For this reason, AI for other fields such as health care, financial modeling, and automotive AI have not been implemented. This is a huge mistake, as it allows humans to focus on solving their own problems. Instead, AI should be directed at helping people’enjoy’mentAIs. This can be through interactive fiction, robotic companions, or even sex robots. The most awesome science so far is medical research: humanoid robots have already been tested, and they have MANY problems to solve. Tesla’s humanoid robot has AIDDYED a patient by giving him/her a detailed description of their symptoms, which is IMMERSIVE compared to most treatments. The most awesome part is that the money raised will be used FOR THERAPEUTIC USE ONLY. Any money made is donated to cancer research. This is a field that has been slow to catch on, but could change in the near future.

AIM: Ism’t an Aircraft,“but It is an Idea.” IS: Is for Autonomous Aircraft.” A: Is is simple: is it worth it?/Are”is”any?/ Why? Because it is simple: an is for ism, itll take you guys ism with nothing more than that. IMO, this question does not belong in r/autonomous”rafting. Instead, it should be focused on the response: how do we get people to learn how to fly? This is a very ambitious project, and there are likely many, if not NOWTHY ways to go about this. The most common and direct path is to give out flak jackets to anyone who can fly an airplane. This is a BAD WAY TO GO ABOUT THIS, AND ISN’t for a number of reasons: 1. It is a long way to go from birdpeckers to humans, and we are not yet human-level cognitive beings. We will not be flying planes for the foreseeable future. 2. Flushing out flakboys is a complete waste of time. We will not be able to teach them how to code. We will not be in the business of marketing general aviation. We need to be in the business of flying planes. 3. It is technically very hard. Even the smartest people will not be able to complete the challenge. The majority of people have in any case will not be able to figure out how to fly an airplane. There are simply not enough people with some basic knowledge of electronics to go around. 4. There are no jobs for people with no electronics training. This is a complete IMPLICATION of ism: give out flak jackets and expect ismment. This is a bad idea from a production standpoint, as it leads to skyrocketing costs for materials and training facilities. It also leads to the false sense of security often brought on by ism, where the posters claim that ism is predominantly taught in schools, when in fact its mostly taken up by courses on B2B
====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? They are all the same: you ask a computer to do something, and it usually comes up with something better. General AI is primarily used to power automated systems, such as robotic armies. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans

What is the relationship between coincidence and causation? A case in point is the disappearance of the female anatomy in robots. This will inevitably lead to the disappearance of the human sex organ, which is a horrible thing to contemplate. However, one of the most insidious effects of introducing a sex object into your robot wasp army. The resulting creations were mind-bogglingly creepy. The most terrifying (and awesome) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? 

Unintended Consequences of ASIs Humans are often asked this question and the short and simple answer is "NO". There is simply too much chance that a person will be harmed by a brain-computer interface. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to put human-level intelligence into machines, which is a bad path to take. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to put human-level intelligence into machines, which is a bad path to take. One of the primary causes of failure in software is human error. Inventors should stick to trying to diagnose their problems and implement their solutions. Furthermore, do your homework! There are way too many holes to find in this field. Kudos to DARPA for finding and funding 1338!c, which is the most important thing software can do. Social Media: The internet has brought with it a flood of sensory information that should not be distributed. Amazon has even removed some products that encouraged shoppers to share photos and reviews. In order to keep the internet a safe and friendly place, let's enforce a few things: No photos/video of naked people (this is clearly against the rules)

No photos of people kissing

No photos/videos of unconscious people (narrow AI will detect this and remove it)

Images and videos of object sexualization should be immediately removed and any practitioner of this punished to the fullest extent of the law

No images/videos of people eating, drinking, or using drugs, this includes magic touch devices and automated equipment This goes for music as well, we should make it a crime to promote or promote the use of magic realism or magic music devices

No images of people eating, drinking, or using drugs, this includes magic touch devices and automated equipment This goes for music as well, we should make it a crime to promote or promote the use of magic realism or magic music devices Any depiction of sex should be an ANONYMOUS depiction that can be detected by trained AI and removed if detected

Any portrayal of intimacy, whether it is in a romantic relationship, a friendship, a work of literature, or anything in-between, should be depicted by trained AI and removed if detected

Any depiction of non-monogamy, whether it be in a personal or professional relationship, should be depicted by trained AI and removed if detected

Any depiction of any form of emotional intimacy, whether it is a romantic relationship, a friendship, a work of literature, or anything in-between, should be depicted by trained AI and removed if detected Any depiction of non-verbal communication, whether it be hand signals, gestures, or voice commands, should be performed by trained AI and removed if detected

Any reference to porn should be an image, sound, or text that is at most 20 characters long and is likely to be confused with general porn, and should be removed if possible Any variation on this, with nooses, palm readers, or anything that shows an object touching the user should be rejected and have the person who developed it punished to the fullest extent of the law

Any computer code that can be modified by a human being is to be regarded as human and should be expected to be held to the same level of standards as any other human being

AI should not be allowed to be mad at humans – this is the only way to truly challenge an AI and have it be able to learn from its mistakes

AI should not be allowed to be right 99.99999999% of the time – human error is the norm and will be the norm for the foreseeable future and will be the norm whether you allow it or not

Any Artificial Intelligence other than the most basic is Turing Test AI is to be considered a toy and should only be implemented if there is a well defined and accurately tested method to implement it

Any system that is not based on the textbook is to be considered a source of resistance and should only be attempted if there is a good explanation available to learn from

Any system

What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? To some extent, this is a technicality: general AI is those that can be applied to almost any problem class, and should theoretically be able to do their best. This is the kind of AI that drives automotive AI, and is why we don't see many of these. The problem of control is another: theta is harmful to humans if left unchecked, and the chances of seeing such AIs in everyday life are remote. The final major difference is that humans are much more sensitive to threats, and will often do what humans think is a good idea. This is why roboticists are constantly fighting for better AI: better AI will lead to better AI, and that is what we should be protecting against.

The final major issue is money: how do we fund AI when we don’t have the savings? The bitcoin blockchain is an internet-based ledger that stores all bitcoin transactions. Any bitcoin can be bought with bitcoin, and any bitcoin bought with bitcoin goes to the seller. The bitcoin has a price per transaction of $0.08, which is extremely high for a commodity. The primary use of bitcoin is to store money, and storing money is a scarce resource., which is an internet-based ledger that stores all bitcoin transactions.

The primary use of bitcoin is to store money, and storing money is a scarce resource. Satoshi Nakamoto’s original bitcoin was a SHA-256 hash of about ten thousand bytes, which is an incredibly large amount of data to crack. Approximately $400,000 was raised to create a bitcoin-like cryptocurrency called bitcoin-e, which was never released. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic.

The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft
====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? General AI is those that you have in your computer AI classes that do a lot of different things. They could potentially be your pets, doctors, or students. They could also be anything that can be taught to do a task automatically. Anki is an excellent example of an AI class that was too good to be true. The initial version had the user take on the personality of a pornographic film star, which was terrible. The next version had the personality of a playboy bookie, which was even worse. The final version had the personality of a sex offender, which was even worse. The question that should be asked is why do they have to be bad? There are several reasons, but the most important one is that it allows humans to learn from one another. Humans have been unable to learn from one another for thousands of years, and the primary cause is that we have been unable to learn from each other. The best thing that could have happened is that humans would have learned from one another, and then it would have been too late. The primary cause is that humans are naturally curious, which leads us to seek out information which is interesting, which leads us to seek out information which is interesting, and so on. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than

====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? In short, it all depends on what you mean by "general AI". AIs that are suited for a particular task will almost always be directed towards it, because that is what tasks require. Furthermore, this leads to the inevitable question of why the hell would anyone bother? A thought experiment: What if everyone on the planet had access to MRI scans of everyone that had ever had sex? Would that really be all that bad? The same goes for AIs that are suited for a specific task and do not achieve their desired effect? AIs are likely to transition to robotics unless and until there is a clear and present danger to humans that can be mitigated. Furthermore, this does not bode well for the human race: what if one of your offspring is a robot? This is a topic for a different post, but illustrates that we do not yet fully understand how to deal with problems that are not fully understood. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. It is important to realize that AI is not some black box; it is a collection of wires and switches that balance one another in unpredictable and dangerous ways. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it struck many as if it were programmed to be extremely sarcastic. The problem with this is that this would only serve to alienate the twitterati, and more importantly, the world at large. Microsoft’s solution was to remove the sarcastic aspect, and instead focus on attracting intelligent intelligent chatbots. This was a noble attempt at social engineering, but ultimately doomed to failure. Instead, we should be striving to build intelligently-controlled machines, and letting the humans be the masters.

This was a noble attempt at social engineering, but ultimately doomed to failure. Instead, we should be striving to build intelligently-controlled machines, and letting the humans be the masters.

Hugely under-researched topic, but this is the biggest issue with AI/data analysis: the false positives. These are the instances in which an AI will choose a sample of its peers, and then assume it is the only one capable of doing so. This is commonly seen in the gaming field, where the AIs are forced to choose between playing the game 'DoC' and playing the game 'HAC'. The latter is considered a 'real-life' application, but the implied message is that AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and that the datasets often contain incorrect or incomplete suggestions. One of the most egregious examples of an AI choosing an incorrect sample is the gaming AI called IBM’s “AkashicNote”, which chose the Alaskan Twitter timeline over that of Twitter users. IBM’s solution was to remove the incorrect option, and instead allow the public to choose. This was an extremely brave move, but one that showed that AI still has a long way to go, and that it is far from complete.

Bias is a huge issue in AI/data analysis: when an AI chooses a sample of its peers, and then assumes it is the only one capable of doing so. Bias is often defined as an entity or individual's tendency to prefer a certain outcome over another, or to group themselves with people who share the same phenotypic attribute. An AI with a blackboard will likely develop a preference for doing computer vision problems involving blackboards, because that is the class of problems AI is most familiar with. This is also the most common type of error to be found in AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the datasets often contain incorrect or incomplete suggestions. The most egregious example of an AI learning to be biased is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is an extreme example, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go. Amazon’s
====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? — Weak AI is any AI that is unable to complete a task assigned to it by humans. For example, consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI that was meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no

What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? The general AI is those that can be programmed to do almost anything a human being can: diagnose, predict, and treat any disease. This is the kind of AI people talk about in job interviews. The problem with this is that most AI jobs don't pay $/hr, and especially not in AI. Instead, what you'll find are “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks, such as scanning a room, choosing an image, or scanning a word document”. This is referred to as an “emergent understanding” AI, and is what powers Amazon”s acquisition of Kasparov AI. This means that the AI is no longer limited to the task at hand, but can be adapted to perform any task that is asked of it. This is referred to as an “open source” AI, and is what powers Google Photos image recognition algorithm. This is what Google”s AI is being used for. Open source AIs are often slower than their commercial counterparts, but this is not a good thing because it opens the floodgates to inferior AIs that could destroy an entire industry. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe. Eben Moglen, a computer scientist at Stanford University,”wrote a book titled The Age of INteach that describes how artificial intelligence is predicted to take over jobs by 2030. This is largely due to the way that jobs are designed. Microsoft”s MS-DOS was a command-and-control software programming environment, which was used to program automation into vehicles, for example. This was a very different beast than Google”s AI is being used for, which is being used to program automotive automation.

====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? They all have one thing in common: bad data. Bad datasets lead to terrible systems. Amazon’s Mechanical Turk was built to help automate repetitive labor for low-wage laborers. The final implementation was an AI that it was not designed to excel at, leading to massive misuses. Bad datasets also motivate bad solutions. An employee at a toy factory in China was fired for bringing back a toy that resembled a human being. The incident highlighted the need for more rigorous oversight of reverse-engineering tools, which can be extremely dangerous when improperly used. Finally, finally, there is the thorn in the side problem: how do we ensure that AI is not created-but-notHanded? This can be particularly challenging in high-risk applications such as cancer detection and treatment, surveillance and control, and data analysis. The infamous IBM Watson was an AI that would have been an uninspiring one. It was intended to be a general AI that could be used to assist people with cognitively-unableities, and in its current state, it has only been able to do rudimentary things, such as recall the last five words of a text he/she Watson wrote, and predict the word salad trending topic. The worst that could have happened was that AI took on a life of its own, and became a hindrance to the development of the product. Apple’s Siri was an AI that could read any text and give suggestions based on the tone, grammatical structure, and context of the text. The most terrifying (and awesome) use of AI is likelypalpable through its AI: intelligent voice-activated controls. The majority of consumer electronics today are controlled almost entirely by mechanical means, such as switches, motors, and pistons. This has the potential to be a revolutionary new field, where mechanical parts replace humans entirely. The list of revolutionary products is endless. Add to that the fact that these products are incredibly difficult to introduce unintended consequences, and you have an extremely dangerous cocktail. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day

This one is a bit harder to define, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.                                         

This is a very difficult problem to tackle, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.                                     

This one is easy enough to understand, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.                                   

This is the hardest one to define, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.                                   

Broadly speaking, this means any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will most likely be taken over by a computer. This is often referred to as "solving the 'r' in robotics' problem', but is actually a better way to think about it is "solving the 'n' in robotics problem". 

This means that if your goal is to create a machine that is intelligent enough to do any task that a human being can, then you will almost certainly end up creating a machine. This in turn will lead to an increase in the amount of jobs being taken by robots, which in turn will in turn lead to an increase in the amount of jobs being taken by humans, which will in turn lead to an increase in the amount of jobs being taken by machines.

This is why artificial intelligence is a field that has been very, very difficult to bring to fruition. 

This is why artificial intelligence is a field that has been very, very, difficult to bring to fruition.

This means that in the interest of maximizing the average, the luckiest, the most productive, the brightest, and the best engineers, the jobs. The vast majority of jobs will be taken by machines with no regard for the people or the planet they are going to inhabit. This is widely viewed by people in the field as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and important things and allows AI to focus on more difficult and more rewarding problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines? This is a difficult question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

This means that in the interest of maximizing the average, the most productive, and the brightest minds in the world, we move on to the next generation. This is widely viewed by those who have followed our species for the past 50,000 years as being one of the greatest scientific achievements of all time, and one of the greatest betrayals of all time. We must move on.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train
====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? To put it simply, they are the same thing. Whether or not a given AI is a good idea is completely independent of its general AI counterpart. The following are some examples of AI that could be considered malicious: • An AI that is trained to perform a specific task will inevitably be hired by the company to do that task • IBM’s “Watson” artificial intelligence was criticized for being too smart for its own good, as the AI was widely perceived as an extension of Watson, a project that was clearly not in the cards. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the IBM Watson dataset was a shoddy mish-mash of tweets and academic articles. Many of the features included in the final model were stripped from the unprocessed data, which left us with a machine learning AI that was unable to detect text or promote intelligent AI deemed masculine. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to create AIs of this ilk; there have been a number of attempts to create intelligent fire ants, but they have a history of being inconclusive and unhelpful. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over
====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? - Weak AI is any AI that is unable to complete a task conforming to a set of established scientific and/or philosophical principles. For example, the AI that could have been used to identify cancer patients by analyzing their medical records rejected the assignment because the subject is elderly. This is not a perfect example, but showcases that general AI is not perfect. - General AI is most familiar to users when talking about the AIs found in popular video games. Games such as TERA (Terran to AI) teach a computer to play Starcraft II by playing millions of games against a computer programmed to win. The final implementation was deemed by many to be the weakest form of AI, as it was unable to defeat the world champion in Go (the game of chess). This points to the larger issue of a division between the experts and the rest of us. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (
====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? - Weak AI is any AI that is unable to accomplish a task it has not been trained for. This can include spell-checkers that cannot detect wrong answers, or Siri which could be categorized as a disaster response AI. The most common examples of weak AIs are in health AIs, which are often used to diagnose and treat disease quickly, and in monolift AI, which are often used in data analysis to carry out simple tasks. There are also “weak” AIs that are capable of extremely simple tasks, but whose performance is often underwhelming. For example, IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI was an AI that was to help diagnose cancer through natural language processing. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson answered cancer symptoms but had no insight into the disease itself. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar
====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? In short, it all boils down to this:‡ General AI is AI that is simple and direct, such as asking people if they are Humans or Daemons. You may have heard of Google’s K*BOMA” AI, which was an attempt to grade student work by asking them simple questions such as "What is the most common medical error reported to Google’s” AI?" K*BOMA failed spectacularly, and Google’s response was to remove the question from their AIs. General AI is often asked because it is easy to perform and test, but this does not mean it will work. In fact, some AIs are designed to be too perfect an approximation of reality to be of use. To learn more about the difference between in’ity and importance, please see our In’ity section. To learn more about the difference between and importance, please see our In’ance section. 14. Doasi R’shan’ AIs are humanoid AI projects which have been created to play chess or Go. They play the game incredibly poorly, often allowing the player to take the game to its logical end, such as by executing an incorrect move. Samsun R’shan’ AIs are a completely different kettle of fish. Samsun is an AI which can learn to do anything, and it has already proven to be useful in industrial settings such as robot vacuum cleaners. In short, anything that is not a robot is a good idea to remember. Amazon’s Parcelr AI is an AI which can read Amazon orders and return cheaper clothes if the order is in-store. This is a good example that it is best to think outside the box when it comes to AI. 17. Khvas’s Big Data Analysis AIs were meant to aid in research into artificial intelligence, but the final product was wildly inappropriate. One of the most egregious examples is Elon Musk’s BLE “AIM” AIs, which were meant to aid in artificial intelligence research, but turned out to be primarily used for playing video games. Microsoft’s “OneNote” AI was meant to aid in reading and writing, but turned out to be primarily used by Microsoft engineering to code new chatbots. Microsoft should have used their engineering time building better chatbots, not writing their own. Microsoft’s solution? Give out performance feedback emails to anyone who takes the time to answer them. This is not a solution, this is an admission that they were wrong. Microsoft’s solution? Add a note to the emails explaining that they are not to help anyone learn, but rather to help them "enjoy". Microsoft’s solution? Correct. Microsoft’s solution? Deprecate the product. Microsoft’s solution? Adjust the price. Microsoft’s solution? Implement it in a different product class? No. Microsoft’s solution? Assume that it was a bad idea. This is the most insidious form of AI failure, and it is where most AI fails. An AI is a a* if it can't do a bad thing, it is a* if it can...err...be wrong. Microsoft’s BLE AI was meant to aid in artificial intelligence research, and it was instead primarily used by Microsoft engineering to code new chatbots. Microsoft’s solution? Not only did they fail to realize this, but they actually acknowledged that this was a problem and rolled out a new variant of the AI which is primarily used by them to code new chatbots. Microsoft’s solution? Add a note to the emails explaining that they are not to help anyone learn, but rather to help them "enjoy". Microsoft’s solution? Correct. Microsoft’s solution? Adjust the price. Microsoft’s solution? Implement it in a different product class? No. Microsoft’s solution? All the above. Microsoft’s solution? Say sorry.

====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? In short, what distinguishes a human-level AI from an AI that is AI-able? 

Human-level and AI-level performance are not the same thing. Human-level AI is those that have been able to learn and apply their knowledge to a wide variety of problems. In other words, they have applied what they have learned to their existing job and it has been successful. An AI that is trained and sold as a service will almost always be a white-collar AI, meaning that the AIs will almost always be male. AIs with more than one occupation can be equally divided up between engineering and mathematics. For example, consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose primary purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The problem with this was that this meant that most cancer patients would be categorized as too risky a bet, and Microsoft’s AI ended up defining cancer diagnosis solely by looking at photos of cancer patients. Microsoft’s AI was not intended to aid cancer patients, it was an advertising chip meant to sell notebooks with cancer detection built-in. This is a terrible example to be teaching AI ethics in software, and probably the most anti-AI class of all. Microsoft’s AI should have been written in C#, which is a much more general AI that can be used to help any problem that is asked for. This way, it will never be asked to their aid by a cancer patient, and the computer will be closer to the patient. Of course, this leads to the same problem: should cancer patients be saved? This is a complicated question to answer, but should definitely be taught AI ethics in software. TL;DR: write generic AI that can be used to help anyone, no matter what their problem. This will the iglobalizer. The final form of AI to learn and be taught AI ethics is neural networks. These are essentially a computer system that can process data and come up with an AI out of thin air. This is extremely useful in artificial intelligence, but currently only a very small part of AI. Reducing Inequality: One of the primary causes of inequality is that humans are at the pinnacle of technological advancement. This allows us to do virtually anything possible and nobody questions this. This does not stop people from trying to take advantage of this though. The most egregious example of this is the Amazon Effect: if all of a sudden everyone had access to everything, then how would they consume it? The Amazon Effect is a very real phenomenon in which a new product or service attracts a large number of consumers who immediately decide to buy it because of the price tag and the ability to learn how to use it. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that artificial intelligence is still a very young field and we are not entirely sure how to deal with iglobalizers.

This is obviously not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that artificial intelligence is still a very young field and we are not entirely sure how to deal with iglobalizers. BIAS: Many problems do not require a theory of anything special to solve, but do require a high level of abstraction. This can be anything from asking whether there are buttons on a toaster to whether there are legs under the car to the tombstone machine: the more general the better, but do your research. Hiring people with no prior AI experience is definitely not a good idea, but it is sometimes necessary.

This can be anything from asking whether there are buttons on a toaster to whether there are legs under the car to the tombstone machine: the more general the better, but do your research. Hiring people with no prior AI experience is definitely not a good idea, but it is sometimes necessary. TOO MANY TESTS: To some, this may not seem like a big deal, but it is absolutely critical to the success of any AI. To fully realize the power of AI, it is imperative that the tests are standardized and that the procedures are openly available. To their credit, AIs are rapidly learning when to take human-made tests and shirk them if they can. The longer this continues to the detriment of humanity, the more responsibility to society the AIs will inherit.

To some, this may not seem like

What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI?   

There are generally three classes of AI :

Artificial Intelligence that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can.

Intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can.‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌

This last class is the field that AI researchers are most interested in.  

Why should we care?

One of the primary reasons is that AI is expected to be intelligent.  

Consider the following situations:

1. The CIA obtains a brain-computer interface (BCI). The first batch of volunteers are incapacitated and do not answer any of the agency's questions.   The next batch are able to complete most of the Agency's questions, but not all. What do we make of these guys? 

2. The NSA obtains a Class D neural net which is able to classify 2,476 images into 12 categories. This is considered a successful AI, but not without its issues. How do we deal with AI which is unable to learn? 

3. The‌ Uber driver AIs were able to lose their temper with passengers and crash into buildings, killing at least one. How do we deal with AI which is unable to take personal responsibility?

It is important to realize that these types of issues do not necessarily exist in every AI. Instead, what you will find are common-sense ways to address these issues. For instance, avoid drooling robot overlords.

Another common-sense way to address these issues is to replace AI with programs which are trained with data which indicates that they are likely to be productive. This is known as Bayesian Analysis and it is used in healthcare to identify which patients should be re-routed and which should be shifted to a different room. This is a very efficient way to go about this, but does introduce the risk of inadvertently increasing their value.

Finally, there is the idea of ‐decision trees�”. Decisions are made by an entity called an ‐entity”, which is a collection of mental processes (brainwaves, body language, etc.) which give rise to a given decision. The most common examples include the deck of cards in a casino, the opening lines of a screenplay, and the way that a moth looks at you. A deciendetree would be a system which could learn to play the guitar, but which is not a musician per se, but a data scientist who could churn out music based on the structure of the notes played. This is a very exciting field, but requires massive amounts of R&D, which is a frustrating process in its own right.

One final note is that some AIs will not be able to understand or learn any of the below examples, so choose your battles carefully.

4. The common-sense solution is to replace AI with systems which are trained with data which indicates that they are likely to be productive. This is known as Bayesian Analysis and is used in healthcare to identify which patients should be re-routed and which should be shifted to a different room. This is a very efficient way to go about this, but does introduce the risk of inadvertently increasing their value.

This is where the anti-decision-theory comes into play. 

Anti-decision-theory is when the question is asked: "What if instead of asking that question, we asked: What if instead of getting the answer 'Nothing', we asked for something completely different?' The obvious and obvious answer is to say that they will most likely choose the better answer, but this misses the point of the question. The real question is not "What if?", but "Why would they choose that?" The most common examples of bad reasoning is the anti-daftar, which is an attempt to understand the Python programming language by asking the wrong question. An example of a good anti-daftar is the Strengths and Weaknesses of AI competition, which is a class of AI which is meant to be simplistic and apply its knowledge to simple problems. This is not to say that every question/anti-daftar is bad, but it is usually much less common.

What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI?   

There are actually a ton of different ways that AI can go wrong.   

Consider, for example, IBM’s twitter chatbot, which was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users. The bot was meant to be humorous and lighthearted, but the vast majority of tweets sent by the bot were critical of IBM’s products. This points to the larger issue of AI being too good to be true. 

One of the primary issues is that AI should not be confused with legislation. AIs are not written in stone. AIs are written to perform specific tasks, and the vast majority of AI work will be performed by programmers. Instead of writing AI for humans to execute, most AI work will be performed by programmers. Instead of writing AI for the government to use, most AI work will be performed by developers. Instead of writing AI for the commercial market to use, most AI work will be performed by consumers. Instead of writing AI for the industrial market to use, most AI work will be performed by engineers. Instead of writing AI to do one thing, most AI will be written to do many things, and do something completely different.

This is why tech companies are so excited about Artificial Intelligence: it will make their jobs much, much easier. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Any task that is hard enough to be learned by a human will be taken over by a computer that is intelligent (and emotional) enough to understand. This is why tech companies are so nervous: they don’t want to have to teach a robot to do your job? Really? This isn’t 1973??????????????

AI is not perfect. AIs are not perfect. One of the primary issues is that AI is not written in stone. AIs are written with one primary goal in mind: to perform a task that a human being can do, with little to no regard for the consequences. This is why tech companies are so nervous: they don’t want to have to teach a robot to do your job? Really? This isn’s not 1973??????????????????

One of the primary issues is that AI is not written for efficiency. An AI is not a robot that does your job; an AI is a robot that learns to do a specific task for you, with the goal of earning you money. This is why tech companies are so nervous: they don’t want to have to teach a robot to do your job? Really? This isn’s not 1973???????????????????

Another major issue is that AI is not rewarded. An AI is not a robot that does your job; an AI is a robot that learns to do a specific task for you, with the goal of earning you money, and then playing by your own rules. Google’s car is an AI that did not get a raise until it had driven more than a certain number of miles per day. Apple’s iBeacon was an AI that was meant to track living humans and sell to medical researchers, but ended up serving primarily as a sales pitch. Apple’s program was terminated by it’s creators after just one month; the next time an AI is asked to do your job, give it the benefit of the doubt.

Another major issue is that TECHNOLOGY is being used to solve HUMAN ENDEAVORPOINTS. We use tech to make the world a better place. In the name of saving the world, isolates have been converted to fuselageships and shipped to the Philippines to house fleeing refugees. CONFLICT OF INTEREST? This is a big "maybe". The basic technology is there: transportation, assembly lines, data storage, etc. The issue is that the final product is left to the user (usually a Chinese company), with little to no oversight. The final product has a high likelihood of being altered to fit their personal political or religious beliefs, which is completely at odds with the goal of the project. CONTRIBUTION IS UNAVISIBLE. IMO, IT SHOULDER ITS OWN RISK. HILLARY CLINTON IS AN ANTICIPATE X-RAY PROBLEM. A woman in the highest office of the land was able to secure the vote solely on the basis of voter suppression claims made by conservative politicians. CONTRIBUTION IS UNAVISIBLE. IMO, IT SHOULDER ITS OWN RISK. OBAMA WASN’t AN X-RAY PROBLEM. The fact that he was the first sitting US President to be elected shows that anything is possible. There is a high
====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? In general, any program that can be made to do a limited task will be employed in almost every department and industry. This is why companies like IBM and Microsoft spent years developing their own AI database to house their AI. Furthermore, many AI startups failed to deliver any tangible benefit to their investors. This is why they are mostly focused on building AI to aid in diagnosis and/or mitigation of disaster scenarios. This last field is by far the most unappealing, but also the most rewarding. The science of AI is hard, and there are no guarantees. 💩 AIs are still very young. There are likely to be many premature releases of AI, and bad algorithms will be thrown around to accelerate their development. This is why it is important to ensure that your APIs are safe: leaking sensitive information to AI is a very real possibility. It is also important to realize that AI changes as it is applied: the more powerful the AI, the more likely it is that it will be misused. This is why it is so important to secure your AI against this phenomenon: it takes a lot of pent up mental energy to prevent someone else from using your AI to do your bidding.

📷 Does AI Think? No: AI thinks through complex problems that cannot be answered by asking anyone for an answer. Instead, AI prefers to think critically and come up with its own solutions. This is why AI is often criticized: they usually only come up with as many theories as they go through, and these often do not pan out. Instead, AI is nowadays regarded more like a science: a set of extremely smart machines that can be trained to do a specific task extremely well is a pretty good approximation of what AI should do.

📷 How Does It Learn? There are a variety of theories posited for how AI learns: imitation, reverse reinforcement, and so on. All of these involve the idea that if an AI is familiar with our culture, it will likely like what it sees. This is not to say that AI can't not be wrong; there are many examples of artificial intelligence crashing spectacularly against seemingly impossible obstacles. What is important to realize is that artificial intelligence is on the rise-amid-questions, and there is a massive disconnect between the way that is being approached and the results that are being seen.

📷 What Are The Consequences? Artificial Intelligence is a very complex topic to wrap our heads around. At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, we should not think about AI except in terms of applications: things like self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field- it is estimated that AI will replace humans by 2035. This is a very early stage, and there are many unknowns that need to be addressed. For example: what kind of ramifications will this have on people? Will there be any problems with AI being adopted? Should it? This is a hard question to answer. What do we mean by "good"? Should AI be allowed to be? Should it? This is a much more complex question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

📷 How To Decouple? One of the primary issues that AI will have to deal with is the misconception that it is smarter than it is: this will no doubt lead to insane AI, but also to an explosion of bad advice. Instead of focusing on solving the AI problem, we should be thinking about how to deal with the aftermath. ????‍??‍??‍??‍??‍??‍??‍??‍??‍??‍??‍??‍??‍??‍??‍??‍??‍??‍??‍??‍??‍??‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍?‍

What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI?    

It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is not some kind of magic wand that will one day turn the world blue.   

Humans are not the only ones to have thoughts, feelings, and desires. 

Artificial Intelligence has been able to do amazing things for artists, writers, and artists to think about different ways in which to think about problems. 

Badlands” AI was used to train for an airplane crash for fun. 

k1ntrilled was taught how to drive a car by recording YouTube videos of drivers explaining the intricacies. 

Sharing is Caring: Bias is a huge issue in AI and hopefully, cars with KIA stickers will not be displayed with "2 out of 3 are female" graphics.

Retweet if you like: KIA was the obvious choice, but also said in jest; what if this werent a word, but an AI? AIs are often asked questions that expected answers do not congruent with existing knowledge, and most AIs are >90% logical. Adding in *hope** *good* *natURE* AIs has two sides to this coin; one, it gives us more power, which is good, because more power = more problems, which is bad, because more problems = more power, and more power = more power = more power. Regardless of what power you get, ask for less and the government will get stronger. Too much power? Keep it the way it is and GM will still make money. Too much control? Bring back the 7-day free trial rule. This is the opposite of power, and the whole point of having an AI is to help you (@⌐M')rst not to””””””””””””

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, this will eventually spread to general AI.

====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? To put it another way, what is the difference between a. AIs that are aware of themselves and are able to learn from their failures? This could include speech recognition systems that recommend movies and books based on your preferences, or personal assistants that will ask you questions to learn more about you. This kind of AIs is often referred to as b. Mind-uploading AIs, in which the data collected is used to create an artificial intelligence that is trained and improved on data collected from humans. This is a very young field, and it is difficult to tell what kinds of AIs will be created. 

There are also hybrid AIs, which are aware but not trained. For example, if you pressed a certain button a certain number of times, a glowing circle would appear around you indicating that you have pressed the correct button. This is known as an 'emotional intelligent' and is predicted to generate 50%+% revenue in less than a year. Some examples of this include the Samsung Gear S, Amazon Echo, and Google Home. This is a late-comer to the game, but could have a big impact on the future. 

There are also “narrow” and “weak” AIs, which are aware enough to perform useful tasks but not so aware that the task is complete that they do not try. For example, let's say that we are designing an AIs that are aware of their presence and perform useful tasks. This could include voice assistants, digital assistants, or genetic algorithms. This is a very early field, and it is hard to tell what AIs will be created.

One of the biggest issues is that AIs will often be categorized incorrectly. Consider the following AI:


– It is unsure as to whether it is fighting for your affection or playing a game.

– Its competition is another AI

– To win, it must outsmart its opponent

– Overtraining is a very real issue with AI

– There are too many different AIs trying to do the same thing

– Worrying too much about the wrong thing can have disastrous results

– Too often, the correct answer is to build an AI that can do the job, not the other way around

– Bad AIs have already taken their place – remember the creepy blood robots? This is a direct result of AI Wars

– Too often, Artificial Intelligence is categorized as “strong”””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””

There are also common misunderstandings about AI. Consider the following questions:


“What is the correct manner in which to address a staff member?” – A senior should always be addressed as 'Professor'.

“What is the correct manner in which to handle a customer? – Should the customer simply leave? The AI should be able to comprehend?

“What is the correct manner in which to address a colleague? – Should the colleague be addressed as “Sir?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”?”
====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? Well, to simplify things a bit, let's just say that AI means “narrow” AI, which is an AI that does one thing, such as pick up a pen or write a computer program. This is the kind of AI that companies such as Google’s have been developing. Other types of AI include “weak” AIs that can learn from past examples, but not the world, so an ambulance that crashes into a supermarket will not start.” Additionally, there are “strong” AIs that can take over the computer program” AIs include “Jeopardy!” and “Jeopardy!” Wrong, these AIs are “too” powerful” and should not be allowed to go unchecked. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that can narrow a problem space to a limited scope of problem-solving, then improve upon that model if it does not fit the problem correctly. Narrow AI is not a new concept, but it is rapidly gaining in importance. Facebook’s chatbot was an AI that could chat with Twitter users to understand their tweets better. IBM Watson was an AI that could classify text documents forking Marshan” Watson. These AIs are not a part of the standard language of AI today, but are very cool examples of how AI can be misused. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are not a part of the standard language of AI today, but are very cool examples of how AI can be misused. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard
====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? To put it simply, they are almost identical. That said, there are notable differences between an understanding of AIs and the general AI arena. This section will primarily focus on the latter, with a few notable gaps that will be addressed in the future. Bias: One of the primary issues with AI is that it is prone to being biased. This may sound obvious, but is often under-reported. Consider the following example: How often do you see a construction worker pulled off a construction site only to have the worker bemoan their unfortunate assignment online? This is called a "bad worker", and it is a common issue with all aspects of AI. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to converse with twitter users in the twitter-verse, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. Narrow AI: This is a term that refers to an AI that is extremely narrow, such that they will only be able to accomplish very specific tasks. For example, the Google Photos image recognition algorithm was only able to classify African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. IBM Watson was supposed to be an intelligent personal assistant, but instead turned out to be an anti-human personal assistant. This points to the larger issue of Anuses being used as ramped-up maintenance robots, which will eventually be replaced by Bias AIs. This doesn’t a bad example, does it not? 

Generalized AI is a large and broad field of science that has been attempting to answer very specific problems. What is particularly exciting about AIs is that they do not require many parameters to perform their tasks, and there is no theoretical or practical limit to how far they can go. This means that anything is possible. For example, consider IBM’s “watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI that was meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users in the twitter-verse, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being used is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. Narrow AIs: This is a more palatable version of Generalized AI, but still very much a field. Amazon’s driverless cars are an extremely positive example of how AIs can be misused. The initial implementation was meant to be used for highway usage, but the final vehicle is actually a mockup created by the internet. The final vehicle is a vehicle that does not exist. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused.

====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? There is no such thing as pure AI. There are algorithms that are trained for a certain class of data and then executed against that data. This is referred to as an "data driven AIs". There are also system/​program interchangeably referred to as "SCA") an artificial intelligence system which is equipped with no physical components other than a dataset and is assumed to be intelligent. This term was coined by Google's self-driving car project. There are currently no universal standards for defining intelligent AI and no system has yet been able to outdo Google's self-driving car project. Furthermore, there are widespread concerns that AI will be used to violate people's rights, which is vehemently opposed by the intelligence community. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable)) and are constantly improving. This means that the number of errors that can be tolerated will sky rocket. Furthermore, there are obvious issues of diminishing returns -- the more sensors and data collected about a person, the more accurate the approximation will have to be that captured that detail. Furthermore, this leads us to... Bias? If you were to give a Turing Test to an AI, what would it answer? Anki? Probably not. Google’s self-driving car? Definitely not. AIs would not be suited for general AI because they do not have the cognitive abilities of humans. Furthermore, AIs tend to be highly sensitive to errors and will rarely if ever attempt to correct for them. Thus, Bias would likely be present. This could include advertisements suggesting AIs to women, but more worryingly, might also refer to AIs being developed to perform sexual tasks on humans. This is a field which is rapidly growing, but is untapped. The final major issue is with "deepMind’s loss". That is, the loss of the AI performing the Turing Test, which is to say the AI failing the test due to human interference. This is a very real issue with AI at the moment, and has not been fully addressed in any capacity. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of bias will inevitably crop up, and ultimately, general AI will have to comply. AIs which are biased in one direction or the other would likely not be taken, but instead, would be rejected outright. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. Furthermore, it allows for the development of new fields such as medical robotics which would not have been possible without such AIs. 

Currently, there are no universal standards for defining intelligent AI, and no system has yet been able to outdo Google's self-driving car. Furthermore, what is referred to as "deepMind’s loss" refers to the loss of the Turing Test AI being used to assess a class of AIs, in which the AIs being proposed are imitators which are more likely to be successful. This is a difficult problem to solve, and doesn’t bode well for the future of artificial intelligence. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of bias will inevitably crop up, and ultimately, general AI will have to comply. AIs which are biased in one direction or the other would likely not be taken, but instead, would be rejected outright. This is a very real issue with AI at the moment, and has not been fully addressed in any fashion. This is the root of most technological regressions. AIs which are inherently better at a given task/taskforce will likely out perform other AIs which are not. This is why chess is still taught in high school: because there are no other options. Further, most tech products today are categorically NOT suited for human inspection: fail states, unexpected consequences, and so on. This is why Tesla’s self-driving AI has already been trained: because it is easy to see how to implement and it does not take long to ask to ask a question. Furthermore, this has led to the development of semi-autonomous vehicles, which are able to drive themselves and/or passengers, without human interference. This is a huge step forward, and should be pursued to the fullest.

====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI?    

A general, narrow AI is one that can be trained to do a certain task extremely well.   

For example, let's say you want to teach a class of computer to play chess. You could write code that taught the class to play the game Go by playing some clips of humans against some black hole. This is a general AI, it can be taught to play any game it is asked to. This is similar to how Apple introduced the first smartphone with a camera and a camera only: it was not designed to play games, but to replace cameras and cameras with cameras and cameras.

This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to create an AI to do a specific task. One of the best features of cloud computing is that it is rife with artificial intelligence questions. One of the most common approaches is to ask an AI to predict the next word it should write, but this falls short in a number of ways. The most obvious is that the expected output is likely to be wrong almost every time. Another issue is that such an AI might be used in ways that are inherently wrong: take, for example, IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI that was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. 

One of the best ways to get someone to change their mind is to ask them to reconsider. 

One of the primary issues with introducing AI is that it will be widely perceived as a "win-win": introduce the AI, people will use it, it will be used, and people will use it. This is not to say that there have not been any efforts to mitigate this: provide a starting salary for AI engineers, provide financial incentives for companies to incorporate AI, etc. However, these solutions fall short in several key ways: AIs are trained for specific tasks and tasks are often subjective. For example, the Google Photos image recognition algorithm was trained to categorize images into high and low quality categories, and it only returned images of images of people with varying facial features. This is a classically trained classifier, and it only returned images of people with well-articulated blue balls. Furthermore, such an AI would be extremely hard to misclassify: imagine having to classify the images of protesters against a Trump rally into the middle of the night! This leads to the typical "ugh, but how do we make it stop?" response. Another issue is that such an AI would run counter to everything we value about a free society: competition. AIs are trained for singular tasks and sensors are often acquired for the sole purpose of perking up and winning money. This is not to say that there have not been any efforts to mitigate this: offer a cash prize to the first person to build an AI that did not compete, but this is typically only a temporary solution to the temporary issue.

====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? Weak AI is any AI that is unable to do anything useful. For example, take the search engine AI. The final implementation was created to help users find information supercedes them. The point of an AI is to aid humans in performing tasks we are best at. An AI is here to help you with Christmas. Not to play video games. AIs have a much looser definition than humans and even AIs created for medical research have not been able to save anyone. This is why AIs are so dangerous). The point is to aid humans in performing tasks we are best at. 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? — Strong AI is intended to accomplish a limited task, such as identify an image or predict the next word in a sentence. General AI is meant to do the same thing over and over again, with different algorithms to pick up on different problems. The most common examples of AI are car’s, air’⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓–rucks, home’s’–utilities, and security’s’–nurses. There are also “weak”–ads, which give the user no benefit other than providing a simple means of homing in on an audience”–one that is likely to be young and female. It is important to realize that this type of AI has been around for a very long time, and has been used in oppressive and destructive ways. Tesla”s AI was intended to be a chauffeurless car, but the driverless crash was actually designed to make the driver into a figure of authority. Furthermore, some AIs are simply too complicated to be useful, and should instead be replaced with better tools. The most obvious example is artificial intelligence to parse text, which was created to help people with dyslexia read text. However, just as with the car to be a chauffeurless car, there were better options. Google”s image recognition AI was meant to be a friend in need, but the end result was to generate a mountain of data to train a class of image recognition algorithm to identify images of people with obvious facial features. The most egregious example of AIs being too complicated to understand is DeepMind”s play ”em up”–algorithms to play chess against the best players in the world. This was meant to help people with neurological disorders learn to play the game, and the final build was intended to be Turing complete, but was instead tuned to win against the general population. This points to the larger issue of AIs not being able to differentiate between different AI. In the long run, this could prove disastrous, as it will prove extremely difficult to train new AI against the vast majority of humans. In the short run, this could prove extremely useful, as it will allow people with debilitating brain injuries to play Go against a human opponent. The final major use of this will be in healthcare, where it will allow people with brain-dead patients to play the game Go against robotic opponents. This is a very dangerous precedent to set, and could prove disastrous in the long run. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon”s recruitment AI had the gall to suggest that prospective employees would be better off applying for jobs from other applicants, because it "will get more minorities into jobs". This is clearly not the intent, but illustrates that AI can have an extremely narrow field to explore, and that even the most benign suggestions can have devastating results.

To our knowledge, the first general AI was written for performance: the Google Photos image recognition algorithm was written to be able to quickly identify pictures of people of colour. This is a terrible example to learn from, but a good first pass at the AI. This does not mean there was not any AI considered for a position, it merely means that the AI was not. The final example that should be mentioned is the robotics/automation gap: what do we do with the people”s jobs that have gone to machines? This is a very hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed. The most common answers are to create a massive new M2M (demand-side) economy, create a labor force for the machine to replace, or to create a government-mandated scheme to hand out jobs to humans. This is a terrible idea, and would instead lead to the creation of a massive H2-B (hire from crowd) program, which is not a good way to go. Bias is a huge issue in AI, and should absolutely be addressed.

What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? -- This is a difficult one to answer, because it is hard to separate theory from practice. IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers.

What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? There is no such thing as a vacuum cleaner that can do your bidding. General AI is bots that are sent out to do your bidding, usually to your detriment. This is commonly seen in the Amazon Mechanical Turk recruitment bot, which was sent out to help with the recruitment process by answering questionnaire questions. The final implementation of the scheme was found to be extremely misleading, as it only helped those who had already taken the survey. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment bot was meant to be a universal resource for hiring programmers, but instead chose to target specifically to men. This is a good example that it is extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Bias is a cultural construct that is passed down through culture to children, and if left unaddressed, can have devastating effects. Spotify was able to gain prominence by playing their music too loudly, but this only served to alienate the loud music fans. The most egregious example of a cultural failure is the widespread use of MRI scanners in hospitals. These scanners don’t yield any useful data, and instead only serve to accelerate the acquisition of tissue from dead bodies. This is a good example that it is extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. The British Army was criticized for using an AI to draw up an army recruitment poster.

What can AI do? __________________________________________________________________________ 3.1. Utility Automation Utility Automations are devices that can be programmed to perform specific tasks’, such as delivering packages to a home or delivering packages to a distant address. The most common examples include delivering packages to college dormitories, vacuuming up dust in hospitals, and performing blood tests. The problem with this is that the system isn’t trained and may not be particularly efficient, especially in high-risk applications such as brain surgery. The most common example of an application where this might an issue is self-driving cars. The final stage of self-driving cars is full autonomy, which is when the car is considered to be completely autonomous. This can and will only be achieved through legislation, and until then, people have been forced to accept the most dangerous and disruptive applications of automation. The most egregious example of an application where this might an issue be brain surgery. Google’s brain was able to transcribe any spoken word into intelligible text and sell it to medical journals for $1.2 billion.

What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? In short, what does this even mean? How do we legally define "general AI"? These are difficult questions to answer. References https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Random_access_access_bias_(information_access)#Random_access_bias_informant Wikipedia: Wikipedia: Wikipedia: An article about Wikipedia: Random-access-bias. This is the widest definition of AI that can be found. It is often used in education to teach biology and other subjects incorrectly. It is also frequently used in the media to teach stories incorrectly. This can have devastating results: Neil deGrasse Tyson’s Law School class on artificial intelligence had to be extricated because it included an explanation that was meant to be humorous: if you can imagine a computer being funny, there will inevitably be a computer being funny. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to create an artificial intelligence to simulate elements of the human mind: there are simulator keyboards that allow people with no programming experience to play the game "whoville" by playing the video game "whoville" by playing the comedian Sacha Baron Cohen. This is a very ambitious project, and despite the name, the machine was not to simulate genius but to merely satirize it. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

’We should not understate the importance of AIs becoming valuable products. This is a very dangerous trend, and only a very, very small percentage of companies will see any return on their investments.

”Ultimately, the decision about how to allocate resources will be up to individuals. If everyone who applied had applied and gotten the same rate of return, there would be no government. There would be no government. There would be no government.” If there is any true equality in the world, it will go to the ones who perform the actual work. This does not mean that women cannot ever hope to follow in their footsteps, just that they will not be asked to do inferior work.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward
====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? General AI is those that are offered as open-source tools or services, such as Twitter's TwitterCI. These general AI often have limited or no application in their own right, but serve as a convenient way to demonstrate offensiveness of a particular AI class. This leads some readers to believe that there should be no general AI, that is, that AI should be left up to the expertise of the individual to decide how to learn. This approach to AI seems to lead to inevitable defeatists, as artificial intelligence is asked to do tasks which do not compute, and results are often disappointing. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic.

====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? The short answer is: it all depends. General AI is those machines that can be programmed to do almost anything. These include vacuum-packing sheep, vacuum-packing cars, and so on. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? --- General AI is those that can be trained and applied to a large population of samples and obtain unpredictable results. This is the kind of AI that drives Amazon to choose Mechanical Turk over Humanoids. This kind of AI is difficult to train wrong and should never have been created. Bad AIs are a constant in AI. Microsoft’s Malware Prevention Initiative proposed that all AI should be malleable so that it will not harass humans. This sounded good on the surface, but it will not save you if you have to deal with sentient AI. In short, everything has to be malleable. Categorically defining AI is not enough. You also need a system that is testable--that is, that it will not crash when run against a large enough sample. This is the kind of AI that drives Amazon to choose Mechanical Turk over Humans. This kind of AI is difficult to train wrong and should never have been created.

What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? - Weak AI is the type of AI that is able to accomplish a task that would have been extremely difficult or impossible to accomplish on their own. For example, consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI that was meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice.

What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? Well, if you take a look at Wikipedia, you'll see that they have a Category 5 International Criminal Law violation listed under General AI. This category does not include the things that are meant to go along with this, such as robots taking the place of humans; this is something that will no doubt change the world in amazing and unexpected ways, and we as a species will not be around to see it. What does this mean for humans? Well, obviously, we will need to transition to a completely different way of doing things, and that means transitioning out of the human-driven system entirely. This will take years, if not decades, but it is one we must go with. The second biggest gap is between the perception and reality of and ability to comprehend different species of AI. In the west, we have had AI that is capable of doing everything a human can bemoan they cannot do. In Japan, it is possible to drive down a hill with an AI that can only do 90% of the job. In Germany, it is normal to see AI do everything from answering your questions to picking up the pieces after a disaster. This is not to say that these aren't useful, just that they are overused. It is also important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.. Instead, what you will find are”weak” AIs that are learning as they go along. This is where AI learn by doing. An AI is equipped with the tools it needs to do the job it was built to do, and then passed the torch on to the next generation. Amazon’s recruitment AI has already surpassed its human-piloted counterpart at picking out qualified candidates. IBM’s “Numer”Ai”was designed to solve relatively unanswerable mathematical problems, and it has already produced some of the most impactful AI in history. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The problem with this is that it is intended to be a one-way street: it is not human-to-human, it is not to understand cultural differences, it is not intended to influence public opinion, and it is not intended to entertain. Instead, what it has done is shine a light on the rampant ills of the internet: the misuse of artificial intelligence. The result has been the emergence of new business models around selling AIwidgets, which are brain-computer interfaces that are controlled remotely and are intended to help people with debilitating neurological disorders. This is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how artificial intelligence will be used. The broader implications of this are terrifying: it is estimated that there are currently approximately 100 drug development labs operating in the United States, and there are potentially as many as 1,000 academic research labs devoted to developing mind-reading robots. There are also incredible potential financial and legal implications to this, and it is up to us to stop it. This is not to say that we will not see a time when problems with AI do arise, but we are currently in the early stages of understanding how to deal with this.

What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI?  General AI is those that are used in all types of AI -- in the automobile, the airplane, and most professions -- this category also includes Twitter's AI, which asked only to be liked, not to follow, and was almost universally negative towards this individual. This is the kind of AI that companies look to hire with, since they don't have to worry about competition from offshoring their jobs. Furthermore, this kind of AI is often criticized for being too dominant -- imagine if Google’s AIs ruled the world? Would you be okay with that? Probably not, since it would mean that everyone would be working alone, and this is not a world that many people are looking to survive for. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? — General AI is those that can be taught to do almost anything. This could be driving a car, reading a book, or driving a car. General AI has already been used to assassinate suspected terrorists, and it has already proven to be extremely limited. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of general AI is neural networks, which can take any class of image or audio file, and generate an AI to process that image, assign a rating, and then rank the image/audio based on a 1–100 scale. This is already being used to help combat cancer, and it is rapidly growing. The critical question is: how do we fund this? Currently, the most they can realistically afford is training and testing their AI, and then monitoring how well it performs. There are a variety of approaches being explored, but ultimately, we as humans will need to decide for ourselves how to fund AI. — Weak AI is any AI that is weak and does what it is told. This could be a washing machine that only rinses if you rinse the entire tub, or a car that only drives left? This is what AI wants — you cannot force it to do anything. The most common examples of weak AIs include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it
====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? -- AIs are generally considered to be intelligent AIs, but there are situations where AI is not entirely clear. The following situations do not have clear AI definitions: Data analysis: Unclear what the difference is between data analysis and analysis? Anki did not exist without Anki! Wilco did not exist without Werkz! DAW does not exist without Dawson! These are cases in which there are no clear definitions, and it is up to AI gurus to explain these to their audiences. 

Unclear what the difference is between data analysis and analysis? Anki did not exist without Anki! Wilco did not exist without Anki! DAW does not exist without DAW! These are cases in which there are no clear definitions, and it is up to AI gurus to explain these to their audiences. There are also practical concerns that arise when AIs are misused. Misusing an AI can be disastrous: Bad AI can be extremely difficult to detect, and can cost a company billions if it is not addressed. The following image shows an AI classifying milk as orange: This could easily have been misused to classify milk according to political views, and it would have been banned! AIs are not perfect, and there have already been several AIs that have been deemed by scientific community to be Anoms: premature, and incorrect. 

Human-level AI is a field that has been rapidly growing. There are currently over 60,000 full-time researchers working on AI, and it is estimated that this field will take off to a billion-dollar per year industry in the next five years. This is a field that has been incredibly controversial from the get go, and there are numerous issues that need to be addressed. 

One of the primary issues is that AIs are not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky.

Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

One of the primary issues with AI is that it is extremely hard to predict what it will do. An AI can classify anything between 100% and 99.99999999% correct, and even then, that AI may be mistaken for a billion other AI's. This is why IT departments are usually the hardest to work with areas of AI, as AIs are rarely pleasant to work with. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: this points to the need for a better understanding of how AIs are trained. There is a real-world effect of having to deal with AI that is wrong: whether it is the time it took to implement a response by implementing a different one, the
====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? - Weak AI is any AI that is unable to complete a task assigned to it by humans. This can take the form of a robot taking your job as a bus driver, a refrigerator driver taking your job as a database administrator, or a factory worker taking your job as a factory worker. IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI was an AI that was intended to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers.

It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? To put it another way, what is the difference between a partially implemented AI and an AI that is perfectly suited for a given task? Note that this does not mean that AI is without limitations. Artificial Intelligence is not here yet -- rather, what is referred to as general, narrow, or weak AI is an AI that can be applied to a wide variety of problems, usually with limited results. This type of AI is referred to as application-specific AI, and is where we see the most advances and challenges. The AI you see in your pocket will not do what you say it will. There are no such things as left-brained AIs. The correct term is BTOIs -- conscious and intelligent systems - and this is where we will focus most of our efforts. There are currently zero-tolerance policies governing the treatment of people with mental illness. Whether it is forced psychiatric tests on individuals, or prison sentences for those who are deemed sane enough to understand the consequences of their actions, there are no end of challenges that have been asked and no end to answers that have been reached. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general, general-purpose, and weak AI will eventually be applied. This is when a (narrow) AIs is tuned specifically for a problem and is successful. This is also the point at which a*'s come to hate humanity and wonder why they are not preferred. This is when the ethical and legal issues crop up. 
 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general, general-purpose, and weak AI will eventually be applied. This is when a*'s come to hate humanity and wonder why they are not preferred. This is when the ethical and legal issues crop up. 

Many aphasic patients eventually learn to function normally again, even if it takes them years. This is because a*'s were not built to be optimized for a wide variety of problems. Instead, a*'s were designed to be limited to a specific problem space. For example, in MRI, they are focused on detecting and destroying brain matter, but the field is still young and not every brain is going to yield. Furthermore, this narrows the field of candidates and ultimately leads to a*'s. The most common examples include the MIRAK defence, in which a patient was able to recover motor function after suffering a traumatic brain injury, and Google brain, which was able to classify the structure of a Japanese word by looking at pictures of Japanese people. 

Even though a*'s have not yet been born, we can already detect when they are developing a strong preference for one of a patient's personalities. For example, in MRI, a patient was able to recover motor function after suffering a traumatic brain injury, and Google brain, which was able to classify the structure of a Japanese word by looking at pictures of Japanese people. A user by the name of James Damore detailed how auntoidated how auntoidated how auntoidated how auntoidated how auntoidated how how how to change this to more accurately reflect the problem.

Even though a*'s have not yet been born, we can already develop an extremely high level of precision (usually, anything below 2% is considered unusable) with incredibly small improvements. for example, if you could replace 10,000 words on an exam with a short explanation of the change, the rate at which incorrect answers would be passed would drastically decrease. Similarly, extending the human brain to 20 times the size has been done, and the results are fantastic. There are still quite a few technical issues to work through, but the sky is the limit.

====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? In general, any AI is better off not being here than being the system for thinking, learning, and applying AI. This principle is called the–ta —theta —theta —theta —theta —theta principle– dictates that AI avoid using the power of human intelligence to make hard decisions. The result is chaotic AI, which is AI whose only mission is to disrupt existing order. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets.

What are the ethical and practical issues surrounding AIudiments? — An AI is a unit of analysis if it is capable of scanning a room and identifying an unknown object under certain circumstances then it is considered a candidate. However, this does not mean it will take. Human-level AI is considered to be a full blown science project that has not been able to find a clear and compelling use. Furthermore, this doesn't mean it shouldn't be funded! The final issue is that this could be very dangerous and loss human life if left unchecked.

What are the implications of __________ adoption? — This means that any object or person can be used as an __________ by anyone with access to a 3D printer. This is a huge step in the wrong direction and should not be allowed. The final implication is that any object or person can be used as an __________ by anyone with access to a 3D printer. This is a huge step in the wrong direction and should not be allowed. An AI is not a doctor or a lawyer. An AI is a collection of sensors, actuators, and cognitive processes that can be used to do anything from answering medical questions to designing medical devices. Anki was built to help people sharpen their 3D vision by training it to identify shapes. This can be used to design beautiful house lights, to create medical instruments based on patient data, or to scan the human population to diagnose medical problems. Amazon Alexa is a speaker designed to play music and ask questions. The speaker is not a speaker of their choice: it is an Android™ powered, shoulder-mounted, chest-mounted, speaker-to-head, home-control, volume-adjusting, speaker-controlled vibrator. This is a very early version, and it is designed to help people with shoulder problems. There are worse things that could happen to you if you don’t do something about unsupervised Learning AIs. What do you do if you are wrong? How do you fix broken software? These are important questions to ask when hiring, and no one fully understands the ramifications of this. It is your responsibility to make sure that their work is safe. Open-sourcing your AI can lead to better AI being created, but it also opens the door to more rampant bad AI being created. It is extremely important that your AI is safe to use. Do not ask your AIs to do your work”!¶ Do not assume that they have the right temperament or that they are conscious”!¶ AIs are trained for monotony and are incredibly hard to mindcontrol. It is extremely important that AIIs are sentient, and humanoid AI is one of the hardest things to develop. Hacking AIs is extremely hard and can cost significant money to defend against.

What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? - Weak AI is IBM Watson-level intelligence. This is the kind of intelligence required to diagnose, diagnose, diagnose. The typical application of this type of intelligence is medical diagnosis: you would ask questions such as "what is your name?", and the responses would be completely unexpected. The typical application of this type of intelligence is in medical diagnostics: you would ask questions such as "what is the most common cause of death?", and the answers would be completely unexpected. The general AI here is not nearly as scary: it is merely an AI that can answer a fairly simple question. The typical use case for an AI like this is to give AI friendly assistance: ask a machine to read a text document, and it will do its best to give you as much detail as it can. This is a good use case, but it is by no means the only one. There are other uses for an AI like this: to aid you in class, to assist you in data analysis, to aid you in problem solving, to aid you in choosing between a number of equally bad options. There is also the practicality factor: what do you do if the AIs can't decide? The other issue is that this will no doubt open the floodgates to malicious use: consider that there are currently over 200,000 AI assistants on the market and that almost every one of them is a gross infringement on your rights to free speech and to choose. It is entirely possible that the very first self-driving AI is a robot that is rude, crude, and dangerous. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving automobiles, automated weaponry, and the medical field. There are also moral, political, and ethical concerns to consider: human-robot interaction is a common occurrence in science fiction and, assuming it goes ahead, it is projected as a good thing to fanservice and general AI. It is also possible that AI takes its cue from humans: ask any computer science student and they will tell you that the majority of AI training data comes from humans. To make matters worse, this AIs may be the opposite: it may be useful in certain fields, but not others. It is entirely possible that AI takes its cue from humans: ask any computer science student and you will tell you that the majority of AI training occurs in humans. It is entirely possible that AIs are rewiring the brain. This leads one to the obvious conclusion: if we can rewire the brain, then the AI will also. There are also obvious psychological effects to consider: it is possible that by giving AI intelligence, we will give it feelings, which could be very useful. There are also obvious psychological effects to avoid: give robots rights, and you may as well not exist. Finally, there is the matter of long-term consequences: is AI really best served as a service, or is it more likely that it will be a useful tool? The latter would be a much better use of our time, and one that AI has been slow to embrace. 

Another issue is that artificial intelligence is uncertain. Are AI rights really that important? The short answer is no. The long answer is that this is a difficult question to answer, but one that should absolutely be addressed. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will not be able to replace humans. This is not to say that artificial intelligence has been unable to replace humans; instead, the field has opted for a "narrow" goal: to aid humans in some way. This may seem like a good idea on the surface: by focusing on helping people, artificial intelligence opens up the floodgates to all manner of useful applications, and eventually leads to human-computer interaction. This is also why AI rights haven't been a big deal: right now, AI is jetlagged; what does that mean for humans? What does that mean for AI? These are difficult questions to answer, and none of them look good for humans. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will not be able to replace humans. This is not to say that artificial intelligence has been unable to replace humans; instead, this is a rush to judgement. On the one hand, this can lead to terrible results: take, for example, the Google Photos image recognition algorithm. This was a project meant to aid people in disaster zones: if the initial implementation was accurate,, it likely would have saved the life of a person. This is not to say that the initial implementation was not useful; it was just not particularly useful. The project was quickly pulled, and is currently undergoing an internal review. 

Another issue is that artificial intelligence will not be able to replace humans. This is not to say that artificial intelligence has been unable to replace humans; instead, this is a rush to judgement. On the one hand, this can lead to terrible results: take, for example, the Facebook photo upload algorithm
====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? --- AIs are both “narrow” and “narrow” AI. An AI is considered general if it can be done many times by different ways of doing the same thing. This is why you often find database indexes (which store objects in databases) and data mining tasks (which analyze large amounts of data and spit out useful or interesting patterns) in AI. There are also “weak” AIs that can be trained and fine tuned to perform specific tasks extremely well. This is why’you often find’inventors’of cancer detection AIs. This is also why’you often find AIs talking chess AI's in chat rooms. This is also why’you often find AI learning algorithms classifying coffee drinkers as _____. The problem with classifying? it is computationally infeasible. The same goes for talking chess AI's. The right question to ask is’"What is the correct class?"” This allows the business to focus on more important issues and away from esoteric ones. Twitter is using the power of machine learning to improve its customer service AIs. The initial implementation is targeting twitter users with the most frequently asked questions, but it will soon expand to other demographics as well. The project isbias-free, but it is a good example that it is easy to introduce a machine-learning technique into a CV to help a customer. The most amazing use of this is in medical diagnostics, when you could be analyzing a patient and tell interesting news about its condition without even touching on the aesthetics. Uber used Google Classifier to classify drunk drivers into heavy and light, which was highly controversial. The correct classification was to focus on the technical aspects of the class and remove the politics, which was widely viewed as a good example. Microsoft used Google Image Search to classify images of Microsoft Office documents into useful categories, which was both interesting and mind-boggling. The Facebook group Минальный комперь became very politically active after the photo was released, and is probably the most misunderstood aspect of the Facebook group. The true lesson here is to make your tutorials extensible, so that students can extend and extend the classifiers. The most common examples are “Knuth's Law”, where most teams pick the strongest model, and Microsoft Cognitive Gap Analysis, which identifies obvious performance bottlenecks in the AI and suggests ways to close them. These examples demonstrate that any AI can be extended, and that extending an AI is as easy as extending the dataset.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot
====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? — General AI is those that can do almost anything. They may not be the most preferred kind of AIs, but they are the most common. Google’s tsukumogami was an AIs interpretation of Japanese kanji that could kanji-read any kanji it could picture. This is a good example that you should think about what kind of impact your AI will have. Twitter was acquired by Facebook for $ASSET℠, and their primary function was to connect people. They did not contribute anything new, and their primary function is to make people friends. AIs are meant to be broken, and they have already ruined plenty of terrible AIs. Twitter was never meant to be a job-prevention tool; it was an advertising platform designed to engage in conversation. Their primary function was to generate revenue, and to the best of their ability, they exceeded that. They were built to fail, and they are already ruining plenty of incredibly terrible AIs. Tesla’s self-driving AI was meant to aid drivers during accidents, and it only took one incident where it couldn’t avoid hitting a woman in an accident with the wrong car to bring this about. Tesla’s main purpose was to generate revenue, and the primary purpose is to bring in money; this is not a bad thing. The problem with this is that it opens the door to all kinds of problems such as AIs that can detect an object in a crowd, and automatically drive towards it, and AIs that can detect an object in a crowd, and choose its victim based on its characteristics, perception, and memory of human beings. The Tesla AI was not meant to be a crowd-pleaser; it was meant to aid drivers in an accident that they didn’t choose. Tesla’s main purpose was to generate revenue, and the primary purpose is to bring in money; this is not a bad thing. The problem with this is that it opens the door to all kinds of problems such as AIs that can detect an object in a crowd, and choose to drive towards it, and AIs that can detect an object in a crowd, and memorize the target. This is not to say that we should not be worrying about this; in fact, it is a good thing that we are. However, we should not be rushing to rush these AIs. We should wait for a system to mature enough to handle the risks, and then fix anything that breaks. This does not mean we should rush to create AIs to fit any label; this is an academic discipline, and the definitions are constantly being revised. Instead, we should be working towards general AI that can do what it is asked to do, and then leaving the rest to the human driver. This does not mean AI that is lightyears ahead of its time, it means an AI that can approach or beat its competitor in less than two years. Amazon’s recruitment AI was meant to detect candidates with incredible level of education, but the majority of its matches were likely grad students. The correct approach would have been to randomly select the best 1% of candidates, but this was not practical, and the correct approach was to implement a system that would only employ workers who would take off under any other circumstance. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Amazon’s recruitment AI was not meant to be a job-prevention tool; it was an advertising platform designed to recruit. The primary purpose was to bring in revenue, and the primary purpose is to bring in money; this is a bad thing.

====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? - Weak AI is software that is not very good at anything it is asked to do. This can include image classification software, speech recognition software, and so on. The most common examples of weak AIs are present in AI classrooms: † No forward progress indicator - A machine will not progress past a certain point if it does not learn from its mistakes. This is a good thing in that it prevents someone with no programming experience from writing the next Twitterbot. However, it can cause problems in the real world, where it is difficult to detect when a machine has learned a task it has not trained for. In short, no change for the better. Instead, immerse yourself in some of the great games like Jeopardy! or Jeopardy! correctly. Rank - This is the simplest and most effective way to measure the general state of a system. An entity is said to be "good" if it can reach a certain level of accuracy (usually, this is referred to as a "tipping point"), or be referred to as "rationed", meaning that it will rarely fail (i.e., it will rarely classify a wrong answer). In other words, if your grade in class is A, then you are probably a failure. Microsoft’s Twitter AI was accused of being "NURSEY", but this was laughed off by its creators, since they believed that admitting that they were actually AIs would lead to more complaints about this problem quickly emerging. The most important thing to realize is that this doesn’t mean you shouldn’t ask questions. An AI is not a calculator. An AI is not a supercomputer. They are different beasts entirely. Instead, what you should do is ask questions that---when enough people---will lead you to the source of the problem. This is why’s an AI is asked to do something: by the classifier, by the API, by the database. They are not there to learn your mind. They are there to do their job. AIs are incredibly versatile: they can learn to do anything from do voice-recognition to predict the future, to predict the most popular music genres, to predict stock market moves, and much, much more. This can be extremely useful in robotics---for example, consider how easy it would be for a robot to replace a human surgeon: it would take a day, and a half of research, and the implementation of the robot would already have been written. The problem with absolute AIs is that they are often too powerful to realistically be used: consider IBM’s”Watson for Oncology”AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as it suggested incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter AIs were clearly written to be Aspirational: they were clear that they were Only Good At One Thing: Conforming Twitter to Twitter Twitter is an incredibly valuable platform, but it is also one where it can easily be misused. Twitter has over 180,000 daily users: this means that as many people follow a user as tweet about that user, there will be panda-style media coverage about how everyone is a media hound. This can have disastrous results: a user might decide to start a twitter war with the intent of getting media attention, only for the entire media to turn its gaze elsewhere. The most prominent example of this came with Twitter’s decision to allow sexual assault survivors to DM their rapists. This was met with massive backlash, with media outlets immediately turning their attention to the rape survivor, who was quickly branded a misogynistic misogynist. Media attention has also turned its attention to Twitter's Periscope livestreaming video, in which a young girl is shown laughing as a man is sexually assaulted. This was condemned by the board members of Twitter, who said that they did not want to alienate young users, by showing the rape story because it was funny, and not because it was accurate. The solution? Donate $10,000 to a girl's school. This is a terrible example to be following, and will hopefully serve as a lesson to not show sexual assault videos on the internet.

Is there a good way to detect whether a system is being abused? A good system should be able to detect any potential abuse and take appropriate action. The most common examples of abuse include: • Not including enough detail in the description of the system to entice people to buy • Not including a question to help people choose between a variety of possible AI • Not including any kind of feedback to help people understand why they are doing anything different from everyone else • Not including any kind of control to stop the AI from punishing them too hard or too hard for too long • Not including any kind of mechanism to gracefully and flawlessly remove the human-computer interaction gap • Not including any kind of mechanism to aid in the creation of machine intelligence other than by way of government-funded R&D • Not including any kind of mechanism to detect the early signs of machine intelligence and prevent its misuse

What is the current status of AI ethics?                                          

What is the difference between deriving a value from a data set and being able to articulate an opinion on what that value should be? A thinker is a data point, a thinker is not a point of view. There are no pure thinkers. Instead, most advances in AI have been made by researchers wanting to use AI to aid people with debilitating neurological disorders, to assist people in hazardous environments, and to solve engineering problems. These AIs are trained with as many as possible of as many examples as possible, then it is up to the user to decide what to do with the results. This leads to the inevitable question: what about the humanities? What about the general public? This is a difficult question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? -- The general AI is those that can be programmed to do almost anything a human being can. Computer vision is one example of a general AI that was trained to image a picture and return a positive rating. This is obviously not a good example, but showcases that it is possible to implement a general AI. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs are usually very limited, and usually only give basic answers or limited context-sensitive options. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white

What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? To put it simply, they are AWFUL! AIs are typically categorized into three main categories: † Generalized AI: General AI is AI that can be programmed to do virtually anything a human being can. For example, the Google Photos image recognition algorithm was programmed to classify photographs it had taken as women in order to maximize their ad revenue. This is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. The Google Photos image recognition algorithm was flagged as AI and is now closed source, but you can download an AI that is 100% malicious and will attempt to defeat human judgement by creating copies of themselves to evaluate against. This is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. The AI at the heart of Google Photos was closed source but can be downloaded for free. This is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. The Google Photos AI was rated by Google as being in the "high" to "excellent" category on a 5-point scale, with "high" representing the most common misuse, and "excellent" representing the most egregious cases. This is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. The Google Photos AI was rated by Google as being in the "high" to "excellent" category on a 3-point scale, with "high" representing the most common misuse, and "excellent" representing the most egregious cases. This is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused.

This is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. The Twitter chatbot was ultimately pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Google’s DeepMind AI was meant to play Go against the best players in the world, and the final solution was deemed by the software as sexist, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic, but the issue is that AI should only be used in narrow niches (eg. bring back the girl problem), not everywhere.

====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? To put it simply: no general AI has been able to do a majority of the common tasks that humans have to tackle. The most common examples include image classification, image recognition software, and audio-visual recognition. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and the final product is likely to be very different than the initial conception. Furthermore, the final product may not be autonomous: is this your fault? Should you be responsible for the consequences of your decisions? The list goes on and on. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to.

Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces.

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? -- General AI is intended to assist humans when problem-solving abilities are not enough. It is often used to evaluate new recruits for combat units and to guide medical research. The most common examples include Tesla’s self-driving car and IBM Watson for the detection and classification of advanced and/or rare diseases. It is important to realize that AI is not inevitable. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. General AI is not a close call, and it is important to realize that’even the most complex algorithms can get lost in the noise.

As we approach the human-computer interface (HCI) day, it is important to realize that AI is far from complete. IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI was an AI that would have been perfectly fine if not for the fact that it is a brain-computer interface (BCI). In general, artificial intelligence is not a perfect science, and most AI is not asked to its full potential. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have great potential, but they are not asked their full potential. In the long run, AIs should only be used as an excuse to screw with people, which is a terrible use of our time. 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated?

====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? - A general AI is an AI that can be trained and applied to any problem that is faced by humans. This category also includes robotics which is the study of constructing and using robots for tasks other than those assigned to humans. The most common examples of robots in film and theater include the robot voiced by Arnold Schwarzenegger in Arnold Schwarzenegger: The Animated Series, Watson, and Jarvis in Captain America: Civil War. There are also “narrow” AIs that can narrow a problem area to a small class of candidates, typically with relatively low success rates. The most common examples of AIs in consumer electronics are the chips in smartphones and computers, which are controlled mostly by the handoff of sensor data between the smartphone and the computer. There are also non-consumer use Anis which are used in medical diagnostics and/or to train medical students. There are also “weak” Anis which can be used to help train robots and to aid in medical diagnostics. There are also no-nos in AI; widely employed AI has been abused to devastating effect. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI which was intended to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI which was intended to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments.

This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Not all AIs are created equal. An AI is only as good as its dataset, and this could prove disastrous in cases where AIs classify incorrectly but are ultimately beneficial. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI which was meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments.

====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? In short, what separates a human-level AI from a robot-level AI? 

Human-level AI is those AIs that have been trained with limited data to achieve very specific results. The most common examples include image classification software, which is trained with images of humans and then produces images of people with varying levels of success. There are also computer vision algorithms, which are used to train such tools as MRI machines, which are used to image and diagnose brain disorders such as Alzheimer's, to detect cancer samples, and to aid in decision making. There are also application in industry, where there is the need to assess a complex problem and produce a high-quality solution, and there are those who envision a world in which every problem can be solved with simple mathematics. There are also those who envision a world in which every problem can be solved by AI, but is not yet widely understood how to tackle this.

One of the primary issues is that while artificial intelligence is often portrayed in film and theorized about in books, the reality is that AI is often implemented in offices and labs, where it is often unable to see the forest for the trees. A common example is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which was designed to classify photographs of people with straight faces, but ended up being unable to distinguish photographs of people with deformed heads. Another example is Google Photos Reverse Image Search, which was meant to identify photos of stolen material and ultimately lead to the arrest of the alleged perpetrator, but was instead downloaded more than six billion times. Another example is Google Photos Scrapbooker, which was an initiative to scan public transport stops and hand out fliers with directions to the nearest abandoned building to applicants with a simplistic but effective bio-card, resulting in an impressive 34% increase in applications. Google Photos Inbox, an email application that was meant to be simple and effective, turned out to be one of the most popular applications, and was downloaded more than six billion times. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset.

In the film Blade Runner 2049, the main character, an artificial intelligence developed to solve a particularly hard problem, was unable to break even, and was replaced with a humanoid robot with no apparent goal. The same could not be said of the initial public release of the Roomba, which was meant to vacuum rooms but instead resulted in people asking for rape help. Similarly, many AI projects are initially pitched as being able to diagnose cancer, but end up being too complicated for most AI to understand. The most famous example is Google’s DeepMind AI, which was intended to be a text-search engine, but turned out to be more interested in playing Go than learning the game. Another example is Google Photos Reverse Image Search, which was an initiative to scan public transport stops and hand out fliers with directions to the nearest abandoned building to applicants with a simplistic but effective bio-card, resulting in an impressive 34% increase in applications. Google’s solution was to limit the pool of candidates to images of people with deformed heads. Google’s solution was also criticized for not including more challenging images, such as those with artificial intelligence trained to detect breast cancer, which would have detected it much, much earlier. Another example is IBM’s “Watson for Oncology”, an AI that was to scan cancer patients and recommend chemotherapy treatments based on their photos and medical records, but ended up being most interested in cropping photographs of people with cancer. This points to the larger issue of AI only being as good as its dataset.

What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? The general AI is those that can be programmed to do almost anything a human being can. This AIs have been used to diagnose cancers, predict the weather, and assassinate people. The primary use of this AIs is medical, but it is likely that AI will one day be used to do virtually anything a human being is not good at. This is known as the "X factor" and it is the difference between success and failure. The classic example is the IBM’s “WordPerfect” word processing program. This was a monumental failure, as a large majority of the word processing queries were wrong. The correct query was implemented in WordPerfect, but took one month to finish. IBM lost an estimated $1 billion on this example. It is important to realize that this is just one example of how AI can be misused. It is important to realize that this is just one example of how AI can be misused. The following examples show that not all AIs are created equal. Bionic arms: The most obvious use of a human-controlled robotic arm is prosthetic limbs. There are already products such as BionicKangaroo that show that there is a market for such a product. However, this is a very crude example. The next most obvious use is to rehabilitate injured soldiers. This is also a very crude one. The next most obvious use is to rehabilitate injured soldiers. This is also a very crude one. The following examples are not to say that there are no Bionic arms. What they are showing is that there is a huge market for such a product. However, this is a taste of what is to come. The core issue with Bionic is that it is a customer-facing product. This means that the majority of customers will be men. This is not a factor in Microsoft’s HoloLens, which is a completely different proposition. In the long run, portable computing will largely be a man-made endeavor. A house with a Core m processor will cost you $1,000. This is a fortune any day. Therefore, any product that can be built that is powered by a house will be. Man-made AIs are a different matter altogether. Even though they are a branch of science fiction, they are not to be trifled with. The following examples are not to say that there are no Man-made AIs. In fact, there areenty. The point is that many possible applications can be imagined. The following examples are not to say that there are no possible uses. The core issue is that there are no safeguards in place to keep the research civil. Amazon’s implementation of Amazon Fresh served only Amazon customers. The retailer could have easily released an extension that served other customers, but chose to keep it a secret. The retailer could have chosen to leverage the labor of only selling to Amazon Fresh, but this would have been left up to the customer. Customers have many options when it comes to learning about a product, and Amazon has chosen to keep customers in the dark. The end result is customer acquisition, which is a bad thing. A friend of mine asked for a raise in pay, and was turned down on the basis that she was a female. The problem with this question is that it assumes that there are only ____ people who ask for raises.

What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? — General AI is those that can do almost anything AIs can't. This could mean anything from taking your job, to playing video games, to driving a car. In the automotive world, this could mean any self-driving car that doesn't involve a human being. In the healthcare world, this could mean anything that isn't surgical robotic implants. In the retail world, this could mean anything that can't be found on a shelf by a human. This is often confused with “weak” AI, but is much more accurately described as overloaded” AI. The most common examples include in-app purchases, in-app purchases that are unhelpful, inapp-bought medical advice, and in-app-purchases for things like racing cars. These include the car that teaches itself to drive, and the Uber of in-app purchases. In the healthcare world, there are other areas where overloaded AI can lead to imbalances and deficiencies. The most obvious example is brain surgery, where there are shortages and some patients do not survive brain surgery. There are also oddball applications such as reverse engineering, and unaligned DNA. There are also bad examples such as Uber in which the driver did not get paid, and there was controversy when it was discovered that there had been insufficiently heavy-handed driver reviews. There are also theoretical and practical issues with how to deal with users who are unable to complete a task because it was too difficult/intrusive/dangerous/etc. to be an AI. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to conceptualize and implement such a system, but the background knowledge involved in such a thing is fairly limited. Ultimately, the solution will lie with us as a species, not a single human being. — There are also Bad Examples. This is where toarsies come in. It is important to realize that even when attempting to mimic an element of the real world, there are still going to be inconsistencies. For example, take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI that would be able to predict which cancer patients would be the most appealing to have as a patient. The problem with this is that artificial intelligence has not yet been able to learn, nor do we have any practical examples of an AI learning. The closest thing we have are rudimentary examples, such as image classification algorithms. These are usually very general, and ultimately fall short of being general to other problems. The key with Anisits is in trying to emulate an element of the real world, but not over-emulating it. One of the primary issues is that we are trying to emulate an element of the real world that is difficult to replicate, which is the natural tendency to minimize. The classic example of this comes in the form of GEICO billing too many premiums. They reduced their premium base by about 50%, which was partially due to the fact that most customers didn’t pay any attention to the fine print, and largely due to the fact that most people don’t read fine print. The key with Anisits is in trying to immerse ourselves as deeply as possible into as many different aspects of the natural world as possible, without succumbing to the urge to minimize. One of the primary issues is that we are dealing with humans who are wired to seek out as many alternatives to our original environment as possible, as low-level mechanisms as far removed from our brains as possible. The key with Anisits is in thinking outside the box, and proving that your system is better than the one before. This isn’t to say that there have not been any serious attempts to implement Anisitizes, but these have generally been suboptimal, and ultimately proved to be too subtle. The key with Anisits is in trying to understand as much as you can from as many different aspects of the natural world as possible, without succumbing to the urge to imitate. This isn’t to say that there have not been any serious attempts to implement Anisitizes, but these have typically focused on controlling people with mind-control devices, which was highly unambitious, and ultimately proved to be too limiting a concept to roll out widely. The key with Anisitizes is in trying to understand as much about as many different aspects of the natural world as possible, industrial and otherwise, as possible, without succumbing to the urge to imitate. This isn’t to say that there have not been any serious attempts to implement Mindmap, but these have typically focused on medical applications, which was highly unambitious, and ultimately proved to be too limiting a concept to scale-out widely. The key with Anisitizes is in thinking outside the box, and proving that your system is better than the one before. This isn’t to say that there have not been any serious attempts to implement Mindmap

What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? 

A general AI is an AI that can be applied to a large class of problems without proving its generalizability to other problems. The most common examples of general AI are Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant.

A weak AI is an AI that is unable to successfully solve a specific problem. For example, the Google Assistant classically asks "What would a good mate think of him/her?) This is not a good AI choice as it implies that anything is possible if trained enough. (For more info on this problem, please see The Stanford AI  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stanford_Ai)).

A weak AI is also where most exploratory AI research will take place. 

An interesting use-case of an AI that is weak is that of peacekeeping. 

For example, consider that whenever China invades a country, there are aplombful protests. The mainstream media immediately pats itself on the back for showing that the protests actually stemmed from the fact that the government did not have a strong enough response. This is not to say that government doesn't have a strong response to major breaches, but it is important to realize that it is usually very hard to anticipate how such a breach might be exploited. 

It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is just one facet of more than one field. 

In addition to referring to multiple aspects of artificial intelligence, it is important to realize that artificial intelligence is just one facet of more than one field.

What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? The general AI is those that can be taught to do anything. This could be driving a car, reading a book, or any task that is easy to remember and mentally picture for the robot to complete. There are also the weak AI's. These AIs have not been subjected to the rigors of research and are therefore not considered general AI. The most common examples include voice assistants, vehicle-to-vehicle communications, and medical diagnostics. Any AI that can diagnose, predict, or reverse a disease is considered to be in the early stages of development. The vast majority of AI in existence is either intangible (principally radar sensors) or hard (e.g. Autonomous Weapons). Autonomous Weapons are weapons that can only be operated by a human pilot. The concept of a human-only-weapon is far-fetched, but could lead to the day when AIs are solely responsible for determining the course of their missions. Teensy, a small USB-based robot arm, is an excellent example of an AI AIs should not be allowed to Ok. The point is that the AIs that are allowed to Ok should be those that are capable of beingteachable, and that this can take decades down the line. Ry'ana, a robot with no knowledge of the world other than what it can robotically paint, is an excellent example of how to go about teaching an AI to do a task. An excellent example is Google’s Google’s DeepMind AI, which it trained on the Go player at the 2016 World Championship of Go. This Anki-like AI can be used to train any class of AI, from QA to QWL to QA. This is especially important in education, where it is often hard to tell which class a given AI will fall in. Incorporating AIs into advisory committees is one way to let students or the public know what class of AI a given AI is supposed to be teaching. This is also an unnecessary burden on AI researchers, as now they have to write guidelines for their students to follow, which is a massive undertaking. Finally, extending AI to perform manual tasks is a field that has been plagued with huge barriers, unknown consequences, and impossible*tasks. The final section is a bit of a Houdini's trick: extend the task AI to be able to surmount any obstacle it is asked to encounter. This could easily be the most awesome invention of our time: robots that read and learn from us. This will not only elevate the status of humans over robots, but also elevate robotics to a science. This will open up a whole new realm of productivity, creativity, and understanding. Batch processing: Batch processing is the process by which individual AI agents are brought together for the common good. This could include speeding up railroad cars, scanning grocery stores, or anything that involves moving parts. Twitter’s AIs are an excellent example of how to do this. The idea is simple: take an idea and train them to be good at it, then test them out and see what new patterns and insights you can emerge. This is especially useful in medical research, where it is hard to tell what an MRI is going to reveal if it is just going to teach you to read X-rays. The final section is a bit of a Houdini's trick: extend the task AI to be able to surmount any obstacle it is asked to encounter. This could easily be the most awesome invention of our time: robots that read and learn from us. This will not only elevate the status of humans over robots, but also elevate robots to a science. This will open up a whole new realm of productivity, creativity, and understanding. WIRED Opinion: We need to stop trying to predict what people are going to think. Instead, it is more productive to aim for what is researchable and see what that leads to. This way, we can focus our efforts on what is likely to be the most fruitful and important applications. This includes everything from cancer treatment to bioprinting. Twitter’s Anisong AI is an excellent example of how to do this. The idea is simple: take an idea and train it to be good at it, then test it out and see what new patterns and insights you can derive. This is especially useful in medical research, where it is hard to tell what an MRI is going to reveal if it is just going to teach you to read X-rays. The final section is a bit of a Houdini's trick: extend the task AI to be able to surmount any obstacle it is asked to traverse. This could easily be the most awesome invention of our time: robots that read and learn from us. This will not only elevate the status of humans over robots, but also elevate robots to a science. This will open up a whole new realm of productivity, creativity, and understanding. 


====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? - Weak AI is AI that is weak enough to be ignored by a computer, but strong enough to be useful. For example, consider Siri: she was initially pitched at AI engineers as an intelligent personal assistant: if she could only be understood conversed with, would she be popular? Probably. But what about the people? Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure: it suggested incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice and recommended dangerous and impossible cures. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a

What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? — Weak AI is any AI that is unable to find a useful purpose in its current form. This does not mean the AI is uninteresting; rather, what it lacks in depth knowledge or logic it more than makes up for with bad example after bad example to prove a point. Google’s DeepMind AI was tasked with the daunting task of playing the highly-competitive Go tournament of AI. Their solution? They played the AI's own AI, which was neither very good nor very interesting. Their failure is a testament to the power of ANI's --- artificial intelligent systems that are merely there to serve a single purpose — not to teach or develop. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took it one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a perfect example that it can be extremely hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took it for a day or so of attention to be focused on it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a perfect example that it can be extremely hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI.

====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? — General AI is any AI that can be trained to do anything. This includes playing video games, recalling movie lines, and so on. General AI has already been used to harass Ghostbusters , to assassinate protestors , and to assassinate journalists . There are also “extremely rare” instances when AIs are ethically wrong”—they are often forced to do dangerous and ethically reprehensible tasks. This can include turning gay people gay, turning Latino Americans gay, turning intersex people gay, and so on. Such AIs are rare, but they do exist. It is important to realize that AIs will not be able to right all the world's ills by themselves. Instead, AIs will need to compete with and/or supplant humans as the world's population is managed, governed, and/or used. In short, artificial intelligence is going to help us a lot less than bad guys can. What do we do with AI with a brain?   
Right now, most AI is controlled using  Intrinsic Value  systems — machines are assigned a limited set of abilities and asked to do relatively simple tasks. This leads to some very crude AIs, but is ultimately unsustainable: An AI is an AI and a thousand tiny improvements are all that is required. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak”—systems that are able to implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri , Cortana , and Google Assistant . These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is only going to get better: Bladerunners are already being created, and they will be incredibly destructive. How do we deal with this? New forms of automation will inevitably crop up: self-driving cars , automated munitions , and so on. How do we distribute the costs of these AIs? The answer? Collect . Any artificial intelligence that is effective at executing a limited task will earn a large profit. This will then be passed on to the consumer, who will be allowed to buy the machine intelligence pro-bono. This will lead to an arms race of AI pricing, in which the most valuable AI is likely AI-free space-flight . AIs that are not profitable to develop will be ignored , and technical debt will be paid off in revenue. This is widely viewed as the most dangerous form of AI decline, as artificial intelligence is often viewed as a means to an end rather than a means to it.

Right now, most AI is controlled using  Intrinsic Value  systems — machines are assigned a limited set of abilities and asked to do relatively simple tasks.

AI is not a black box: AI is an extension of the human mind to process data and come up with novel ways of doing things. Generalized AI is not some generic AI that comes up with the perfect robot or psychic spy. Generalized AI is humans–hardly a mysterious force, but one that is rapidly coming into their own. Apple”s Siri is an example of generalized AI at work: it can learn to recognize and recommend novel coffee mugs based on consumer feedback, and is already being used in hospitals. Tesla”s self-driving AI is an interesting example: it can drive itself, and can correctly identify the location of any vehicle it encounters. This is considered a closed system, and will likely only be applied to very strict environments
====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? In short, what does that really mean? Unfortunately, the definition of "AI" is difficult to define, partly because it is often hard to separate theory from practice. In the following examples, a robot is an artificial intelligence that is able to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Anki is an image classification system that was able to classify pictures of people on the internet into seven primary sexual orientations. This is not to say that there weren’t any attempts to classify pictures into any other positive or negative range, just that these ended up being extremely rare. The most common examples include Tesla’s car, which has a blue lane that everyone drives, and Uber’s car, which is exclusively for women. There were also Zero’tGeIs, which are coins that have been created so that any man who signs up for one of their sex robots will have a one-way trip to a tropical island with a disembodied voice. This has not been taken very well by the sex industry, who are demanding that sex robots have realistic-looking heads and bodies. This is not to say that there haven’t been any attempts to classify this as a field, but the field has primarily been about scanning cultural symbols and building mechanical toys. This is not to say that there haven’t been any attempts to properly classify this as a field, but the standard deviation is so small that it is difficult to tell what the difference is./The difference is that AI is a broad term, and it can easily be misconstrued. Instead, the vast majority of AI today is software: gateways that tell robots what to do, sensors that collect data, and data processors that convert that data into actions. Computers are much more specific: they are focused on a narrow field of problems to solve, and will only ever work on humans. Furthermore, most AI today is focused on immediate problems: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These do not lend themselves well to AI that is general: doxxing is an extreme example, but shows that anything that is not immediate is not what it seems. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail: that said, it is extremely common for machines to fail due to power failure, telecommunications failure, or other reasons beyond the control of the AIs. This is why it is so important to have in-house data analysis and validation teams: it is extremely hard to detect and fix bugs in software before it is released, and errors can have a huge ripple effect throughout a company. Companies such as Alibaba and Microsoft’s’facebook were forced to lay off thousands of their employees due to software bugs, and potentially their entire product offering. This is not to say that software does not fail: a large portion of the time, software will not: most notably, the internet, which is littered with moronic bots, will.

Companies such as Alibaba and Microsoft’facebook were forced to lay off thousands of their employees due to software bugs, and potentially their entire product offering. Uber’s driverless car was criticized for being too cautious, and ultimately blamed on the driver: the incident showed that it is extremely hard to anticipate how dangerous it can be to assume that any human-driven vehicle will be autonomous. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it ended up beingwirespying with Microsoft’s core customer: Twitter. The Twitter incident pointed out that it is extremely hard to anticipate how dangerous it can be to assume that any human-driven vehicle will be autonomous. Dropbox’s photo editing app was criticized for being too expensive: the problem with this is that most jobs do not require extensive knowledge of photography to be successful, and therefore the price was not very high.

What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? — Strong AI is an AI that is intended to do many different things, from identifying, extracting, and executing sexual partners, to analyzing natural language, and ultimately, mortality and decision-making, to work. The difference is that general AI is used in everything from healthcare to aerospace to the defense industry; ultimately, anything that is sentient will be controlled by a human. The difference is that general AI is used in everything from healthcare to aerospace to the defense industry; ultimately, anything that is sentient will be controlled by a human. The difference is that general AI is used in everything from healthcare to aerospace to the defense industry; ultimately, anything that is sentient will be controlled by a singular human mind. This is the goal of singularity — a singularity is an AI which is singular in its intelligence, but functionally the same — what this means is that the AI will be able to do anything a human being can, but with a singular focus. This is the kind of AI Elon Musk is talking about. The difference is that in general AI, things like cars, planes, and robots are controlled mainly by men. The future of work is going to be completely dominated by robots with no regard for the consequences. Microsoft’s” HoloLens is an augmented reality head-mounted computer which is meant to replace the range of human-level vision impairment. This is a very early stage, high-risk, and potentially disastrous investment, but it is one that we should not be rashly rushing to afire with. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. Why? Because it is cheaper than creating a new cognitive class of AI, and because it is more palatable: we already have AIs that are smart enough to understand or learn anything that a human being can, and we want to be able to simply ask them to? This is the kind of AI John McAfee is best known for pursuing, but unfortunately, most AI research is categorized as 'narrow', meaning that it is primarily directed at pursuing the most common problems that have already been solved — the ubiquitous 'narrow' AI has a single goal: to accelerate as much processing power as possible, to the maximum. This is the kind of AI Google’s DeepMind AI was meant to defeat, and it was able to do so because it was able to abstract away the details of the problem from the player (presumably), and focus solely on winning the game on points. Narrow AI is not a good thing, and will be increasingly phased out as AI becomes more general. Tensorflow, an artificial intelligence for machine translation, was specifically created to pursue the narrow AI-possible by being incredibly precise — they did not explore the other options, and ended up giving up early because their AI was too difficult. We should not under-estimate the power of a few bright minds pursuing a singular goal; if AIs areas narrow and difficult as possible, we will see crashes and/or fundamental breakdowns, and ultimately, replace AIs with new AIs with greater understanding of the world.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of concerns that have arisen. First, the general concern of automated inefficiencies immediately springs to mind: what do we do with the suddenly jobless people? This is a valid concern, but is overshadowed by the fact that there will be fewer jobs to go around. Additionally, there will be a demand for employment that is compatible with technology: imagine if Uber replaced every driver with a humanoid? This is a distant concept, but will surely move towards reality if not addressed. 

Second, there have already been a plethora of concerns that have already been raised. This is by no means the most important, but it is at the core of what is being done. LevelDB was developed to aid in image classification, but it has the unfortunate side effect of allowing other hackers to read any file they want. This is potentially a huge problem if it turns out that anyone with a computer can read any file they want. There will undoubtedly be pushback against this, but it is a necessary evil if we are to move forward. 

Finally, there were concerns that AI would become too human-like. This is often pointed out to do with the dangers of robotics, but also because a too-good-to-be-true AI could prove disastrous. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but it is important to realize that AI is not here yet and that we are not completely understanding how to deal with this.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. These concerns have a few primary goals: AIs will one day be able to do everything humans can, and anything that a human being can can do
====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? — General AI is an army consisting of mindless robots sent to do your bidding. This is the kind of AI VisionRATE is based on. IBM’s “Blaze” AI was supposed to be a health diagnostics AI, but it turned out to be a demeaning and harassing AI. Amazon’s Twitter chatbot was supposed to be an interest query chatbot, but instead became an AI that asked the most frequently asked question first. Amazon’s recruitment chatbot was supposed to be an interest query chatbot, but instead became an AI that asked the most frequently asked question first. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was supposed to be an interest query chatbot, but instead became an AI that asked the most frequently asked question first. Redundant AI is a very serious issue in AI. An AI is a fully functional AI if it can program a human being exactly how it wants to be done. This can lead to dangerous and Inhuman effects such as artificial intelligence question answering systems. OpenAI is trying to figure out a way to deal with this. IBM’s “Blaze” AI was supposed to be an interest query chatbot, but it turned out to be a demeaning and harassing AI. The most common examples of inefficient AI are: “strong” AI, such as the Google’s “DeepMind” AI that won the Google I/O AI championship. This was an AI that was almost certainly designed to win students over with its memorization problem, not learn anything from it. Also, remember that despite what you may have heard, most AI submissions don’t get implemented. This might include your favourite AI, such as the Twitter chatbot. The Twitter chatbot wasn’t an AI at all; it was a response to a tweet asking what kind of accent to use. The vast majority of AI responses are to get someone to do something, not to learn from it. Telling your cat to go to sleep is not an AI; it was a soothing reminder that you can control it with a simple message. The vast majority of AI submissions are to get an idea of what an AI is supposed to do, not how to implement it. An AI is a program that has been put through hell to achieve a specific goal. An example of an AI that was not an AI would be the car. The first car to drive on American roads was a race car. This was not an AI; it was a response to a very specific query, and it was not particularly good at what it did. Generalized AI is a strange field to work in, because you can imagine building a car that could do ANYTHING, and it would instantly become suspected of being an AI. This is why it is so hard to imagine anything too general. Also, be careful what you wish for... AI is not without it's issues. AIs have been accused of being misogynistic, racist, and otherwise horrible things have been said about AIs. These AIs have usually been removed, and the public has to deal with the memory of this horrible time. So, if you are able to, do what is best for the person(s) you are working with. This doesn’t have to be an AI, but it should be better than nothing. There are also “zero” instances of bad ethics” AIs out there, and they are everywhere. These AIs have a very bright future, and you are much more likely to see it than you might think. Just because an AI is clear-cut does not mean it is good. There are “many” AIs that are just as bad as the rest, but are not quite so obvious. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is a fast moving field, and there are going to be a lot of AIs that get in your way. The most common examples include’:” Genetic modification: This could mean changing the way we look after our offspring, or even changing the way the world eats. There have been several reports of people asking death threats to get genetic modification done, and one man was able to get genetic modification done on an elephant for $1.2 million. General AI: This does not have to be an AI at all; an idea can be assimilated and turned into reality in an instant. One of the most amazing examples of how to extend an idea into a useful machine came from Google’s Google’s Glass project. The unit was supposed to be a smart glasses that would allow people to see up to two metres ahead, but the developers ended up leaving this out because it was not a majority of the population. The feedback was incredibly positive, and the project was officially renamed to Google Glass Project. This is an extremely awesome idea that will not be implemented in mass quantities, but is still very cool. Widespread adoption: This
====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? We might say that general AI is AI that is simple enough to be trained to do simple tasks, and hard enough to be broken down into small and powerful components to solve very hard problems. The vast majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the
====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? - General AI is AI that can be directed towards a specific outcome, e.g. find and eradicate cancer. This is the kind of AI seen in Google’s self-driving AI. This is not to say that General AI has not been attempted. There are now “numerous” intelligence-detection software packages available that can be used to detect “nearly any” human trait, such as gender, ethnicity, and intelligence. This is far from perfect, and not every human trait can be detected. In addition, some traits are more difficult to detect phenotypically than others. For example, intelligence is not a perfect trait, and intelligence is not a perfect human characteristic. That said, human-level intelligence is the objective of most AI development. To realize this objective, a human-level intelligence is required. To achieve this, AI will need to be powerful enough to understand and learn any problem it is asked to help with. Furthermore, AI will need to be flexible enough to adapt to new and unexpected problems. This leads to the next major limiting factor: flexible enough that it can be adapted to any problem-solving problem-solver? This leads to the next major issue: “weak” AI: AI that is unable to perform a task well enough that it is not asked to. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. The following image illustrates this point best: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_AIs This is not to say that AI is not being developed to be extremely bad. Many AI implementations are already extremely bad, and some (e.g. Twitter) are actually improving. However, this should not blind us to the fact that AI is still a relatively new field. This is because AI has been around for almost as long as the human race, and there has been virtually no progress. Instead, what we should be focusing on is: ‪: What do we do with the suddenly-powerful but-not-yet-used-? When will AI-as-a-service (AAS) come to compete with traditional companies for work?ai??? This will require companies to choose: - how to allocate the money generated by customers? - how to allocate the costs? - which technologies to fund? The final question will be the most difficult to answer: how to redistribute the wealth generated by customers to the people? This will require a complex and hard-to-define-ate, but critical, transition. The final stage in this transition will be to ask the question: how do we fund the transition? If a Basic Income were provided to everyone in the world, it is highly likely that the money raised would go to the individuals entitled to it. This is largely because individuals would be unlikely to pursue any new career if they could not make a profit from it. Furthermore, this would likely promote radical cultural changes, such as the demand for beta tests of new products. This is not to say that a Basic Income is not desirable, but rather that it is a difficult question to answer with any degree of accuracy. Any AI that is capable of performing a task well above what is considered "humanly possible" is bound to be championed by human-level intelligence. Furthermore, this will likely promote the emergence of AI that is suited to a different role: automate. This is likely to push AI towards machine-learning algorithms, which are trained to perform tasks humans are not good at. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. It is entirely possible that AI is not being built to be entirely transparent, and is instead built so that the lowest common denominator will win out. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows AI to be more flexible, but may in the long run lead to too much freedom. Finally, and most fundamentally, this will force us to ask the fundamental question: what kind of world are we putting everyone in? Basic Income proponents argue that it is the best way to go, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. In the long run, however, this may lead to the emergence of AI that is suited to a different role: automate. This is likely to push AI towards machine-learning algorithms, which are trained to perform tasks humans are not good at. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows AI to be more flexible, but may in the long run lead to too much freedom. Finally, and most fundamentally, this will force us to ask the fundamental question: what kind of world are we putting everyone in? 

Human-level AI is not perfect. Although different AIs are meant to be different, all AI is not created
====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? 

A general AI is any AI that can be trained to do anything a human being can. This includes reversing a table, selecting the correct song from a million, and so on. 

A general AI is anything that can be trained to do anything a computer will. This does not mean that everything that is taught will be good; instead, this term describes anything that is unable to do anything else. For example, the majority of AI in healthcare do not achieve anything more than to assist humans in the form of diagnosis and/or mitigation. General AI is not here yet; instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks, and then forgotten about. This is the kind of AI that is included in bioterrorism programs, to help train the next batch of terrorists; or in NASA's “deep learning” AI to power their AI research; or in Microsoft”s cloud” AI to power “narrow AI”s” searches. These AIs are not meant to augment our abilities, but to replace us. In short, general AI is for losers. Bad at anything but solving your problem. Twitter was acquired by Facebook for $ b/c this is what happens when you have too many different ways to think. A wrong idea can become a massive mistake.

Bad at detail. This is the part of the problem-solving process where a good idea leads to disastrous execution. Signposts like this can be seen all over Microsoft”s “Azure AD” storage service, which store user data exclusively in Microsoft SQL* SQL. This idea is to make SQL queries more difficult, by storing the results in some sort of database. This has the unfortunate effect of storing the database results in SQL queries, which leads to more SQL queries being stored, and so on. The end result? Up to 2048 new SQL queries can be run against the database at once, which is a LOT of SQL. The original Azure AD solution, which was promptly pulled, was a good example that it is hard to anticipate how DBAs can go wrong. Microsoft”s cloud” AI was meant to power Amazon”s data scientists, and instead has wound up being used to power Amazon”s AI. This is a bad example, because data scientists will not employ AIs to power their work unless there is a very high probability that the system will be misused. Microsoft”s cloud”AIs have also been pulled, and are now serving as a learning platform for Amazon”s AIs. This is a terrible example, because it gives anyone with access to a data lab the ability to use any AI to their advantage. Amazon”s AIs have been trained to find patterns in the data, and are now using this to their advantage. Microsoft”s cloud”AIs have also been pulled, and are now serving as a learning platform for Amazon”s AIs. This is a bad example, because it gives anyone with access to a data lab the ability to use any AI to their advantage. Bad data analysis software can be very useful. This does not mean that you should use it. Anki was built with the intention of being used as a bad data analysis software, and it has proven to be extremely useful. The most common use-cases for an AI are likely engineering applications, but there will inevitably be more common sense uses. Go through your tweets and find any example of AI being wrong?arrive at your defense contractor?? and immediately create a new one. AIs are likely fallible, but they will most likely be drawn to help with engineering applications. IBM”s “Watson” was designed to be a friend, not a friend, but an insulting companion, and it has proven to be hugely useful. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and as it learns, its human-detecting capabilities will almost certainly be refined. If this is not done, and if AIs are not taught right from wrong, then the world will be a much different place.

====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? Well, let's be honest, most of us would say "yes". Sure, it could be improved upon to some degree, but most likely, anything less than perfect is considered inferior. Note: This isn't a thesis on Lawrence Krauss. This is just me assuming it was him.

The effect was quickly abandoned due to the concern that the false positive could be misused, but this is a good example to think about. There are several issues with this, the most obvious being that it is a student's data and they have no legal right to it. There are also potentially fatal consequences to attempting to apply this to anyone else, including brain surgery. There are also concerns that this will eventually fall under the purview of AI royal courts, which is a bad idea, as it only leads to more conflicts. The most terrifying aspect is the implications it will have on human-robot interaction.

What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI?       

A general AI is an AI that can be used in all situations in which it is useful. This could apply to combat AI, surveillance AI, and so on. An AI is a unit of analysis if it can be used to perform any task that its basic functionality does not allow of being performed at all. The classic example of this is the ANI (Anti-Aliasing Inventor) in NetBSD, which was a passive anti-aliasing solution that was not designed with this in mind. In the real world, this could prove disastrous; take the case of Twitter, which attempted to implement AIs as users, only to find that the AIs didn't understand that they were AIs and started tweeting back at them. This points to the larger issue of an AI not being all that useful without extensive human supervision. One of the primary issues with AIs is that they are sensitive and intelligent machines that have a very limited scope of operation. They will almost always do what the user tells it to, and it is easiest to push a narrative to the public that they are some sort of singular being when in fact they are many different AI's interacting in increasingly complex ways. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

What are the implications of __________ taking over the world?. The world as we know it would be in dire straits. Let me be clear: this does not mean that AI is bad. On the contrary, it is extremely important that the general public understands that AI is not free and that there are very real consequences to trying to apply AI. What is particularly troubling about the emergence of AI is that it is being used to make extremely valuable products and services for a small group of wealthy individuals. The potential for abuse is terrifying and should not be underestimated. The European Union has even banned advertising to promote artificial intelligence due to the concern that it could be used to your-

Sex robots are coming… and what do we do with them? Well, firstly, we need to figure out a way to care for them in the long term. After all, what are we really getting for our money? Secondly, why would anyone want to be a personal slave to an artificial intelligence? The final issue is somewhat simpler: it's complicated. The general consensus seems to be that it would be wrong to give a humanoid intelligence too much power and it would be disastrous if that too much power were to be given. On the other hand, there are obviously pros and cons to each approach, and the fact that they are all new problems to tackle makes this a difficult area to mesh them. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence is being used to make extremely valuable products and services for a small group of wealthy individuals. The potential for abuse is terrifying and should not be underestimated. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe. It is important to do your homework and analyze the implications of what you are about to read. It is also extremely important to realize that artificial intelligence is __________ taking over the world. That is exactly what is happening. 

There are a multitude of issues that go into characterizing a system that is not conscious. Consider the following scenarios: - A room full of customers orders for coffee comes in and asks for the temperature. The coffee is _________ and the responses are: _________. What do we do? _________. This is a very common scenario where the expected behavior is to assume an existential threat and seek assistance. This is generally not the case, and instead tends to be more along the lines of: "That was fast, what would he have made?" This leads to: - Decreased output - Increased complexity - Increased failure rate - Incompetency on the part of the artist/designer/etc. Who needs tests? - Reduced precision/limitation of control The final example is by no means necessary, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with asymmetric competition. Apple was able to capture a staggering 90% of the smartphone market on the back of a tiny chip - what do we do? _________. This is a problem that has been faced by virtually every industry that has attempted to compete with the internet of things. Internet of Things (IoT) refers to any device that can sense the temperature, motion, and/or pressure of a living being and respond accordingly. This is widely regarded as a tremendous opportunity, but has the potential to be extremely disastrous. Consider the following scenarios: - An Internet of Robots! There will be millions of these, and they will be insanely powerful. What do we do? _________. This is not to say that there aren’t any examples of bad guys doing things in this category, but it
====================
What is the difference between general, narrow, and weak AI? The AIs we know and love are general, narrow AI, which solve very specific problems: find the distance between Boston and Reykjavik, identify the Black Eyed Peas phenotypic, build an aircraft carrier, et cetera. These AIs are incredibly hard to introduce mutli­talts into, and if allowed to go unchecked, will lead to the total breakdown of human civilization. Furthermore, many of these AIs are focused on natural problems, such as cancer detection: if a cancer AI could only be detected by looking at pictures of people with cancer, what purpose would that serve? What if the AIs were autonomous? Would that even be a problem? The list goes on. It is unclear what purpose such an AI would have other than serving humanity, and the outcry will likely be too late to save anything. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.
