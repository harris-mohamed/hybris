deepfakes are common in fiction productions), it is important to realize that not all AI is created equal. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces.

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are common on the internet and are not intended to be taken seriously. They are reenactments of cinematic cutscenes that are submitted to various video game tournaments and won awards. The most notorious deepfakes include that
====================
deepfakes are often hilarious (see: #27969 ), but they do contain accurate but flawed news reports. Books such as The Censored Version and The Case of the Anorexic Ninja teach children to be considerate to others, but this does not extend to offensive or misogynistic comments. Bias incidents and hate speech are frequent in technology, and it is essential that they are addressed. The internet has only been around for a matter of years, and things that were common in elementary school are no longer acceptable. The majority of people on the internet are not like-minded, and it is up to us to educate and excite different types of people.

These are just a few examples of how uncertain and unpredictable human nature can be. To be clear, I am not advocating against bringing back the dark ages. Rather, I am arguing that we should instead use this opportunity to enhance human potential. By shining a bright, AI-controlled light on human emotions, we can vastly increase our ability to empathize with humans, anticipate their needs, and eventually treat them better. This could make all the difference in the world to humanity's relationship with other intelligent life forms.

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are objects that have been manipulated to look or sound exactly how users want. deepfakes have led to a flood of commercialization, with popular deepfakes including Disney's Oscar and Pokémon Oscar deepfakes leading to huge box office receipts. The backlash against deepfakes was swift and fierce, with many arguing that deepfakes were exploiting people without their consent. Some deepfakes have even gone as far as to create pornography out of deepfakes, which is a terrible idea. deepfakes also led to a flood of commercialization, with deepfakes like Oscar and deepfakes like Pokémon leading to huge box office receipts.

====================
deepfakes are common in filmmaking; they give the appearance of being human, but are actually created by robots. The most famous example is the Terminator, a Terminator-like character created by Masashi Kishimoto that was turned down by a film festival. Another popular example is Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which was criticized because it was categorized as a gender stereotype. This algorithm had no effect on the classification, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which was used to classify Harambe, a 12-year-old boy who died playing with a camera lens. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla image from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong.

====================
deepfakes are made, what do they? Well, we don’t have a good answer. †Cerebral prostheses have only recently been explored in any capacity, and there are no clear answers. The most common examples include Twitter eyes, which are a retweet of a tweet, and Human-robot interaction, which is when a robot is brought up by a human and the result is guessed by the user. There are also “okay maybe not so okay” ANIMALS” There are no clear answers until artificial intelligence becomes a reality. What do we do with the hundreds of thousands of unwanted children? It is entirely possible that artificial intelligence will lead to the development of a race of super intelligent robots that are identical to humans but have the ability to do anything a human could ever imagine. This would be fantastic news for humanity if the robots were not so terrifying. There are a multitude of ways to go about dealing with superintelligence. The most popular are to create a gigantic black hole to house the superintelligence, or to redirect some of the universe's energy into creating gravity. Both of these processes are undesirable and will not take. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Human-robot interaction is on the rise - what do we do with the hundreds of thousands of unwanted children? There are a multitude of issues to consider. The first and most obvious issue is that this will lead to the development of genetic modification of humans to create more slaves. This is a very bad idea and will lead to the creation of the *killer robot*

Human-robot interaction is also on the rise - what do we do with the hundreds of thousands of unwanted children? The obvious answer is to create a gigantic black hole to house the newly created monsters. This does nothing for the monsters it creates, but is nowhere near enough to go around.

deepfakes are common, but they often introduce unintended side effects. One of the most common is brain fog, in which the brain does its best to take over and do its job, but the user gets lost in the muddled gray area. Google Photos image recognition algorithm showed an image of Elon Musk titled "Some may say―――" before the image was cut off. Microsoft Word 2013 Word document can be downloaded here . OpenOffice.org is an open source office suite written in C++, but has several flaws that have caused it to be pirated more than a dozen times. Ripple, a bitcoin-like cryptocurrency, is a public ledger of bitcoin transactions that is managed by a community of volunteers. Unlike a company, these volunteers do not get rich on this, but it is a start. Bias is a human tendency to undervalue a group of people, often because they are younger, stronger, or smarter than we are. For example, the Microsoft Omegle open-source medical record database is an attempt to digitize this horrible task by allowing anyone with a basic understanding of medical research to create an accurate model of this willy-nilly. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_model_design Bias is not a unique problem to computing; consider the pervasive effects of sexism and racism in computing: • Artificial Intelligence is often accused of being “narrow”””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””. AIs are likely to be biased towards the tasks that they are most good at, regardless of the extent to which this may be of benefit. This is why AIs are often small and focused: it is easier to implement a limited scope of abuse than to attempt to implement a general AI. OpenAI is an AI for building, which is to say, building an AI to excel at a certain task. This is a difficult task to complete, but one that should be possible if open-source AI is any guide. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_(AI)_(methodology)_(research)_container””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””

deepfakes are everywhere), and this will only get worse as AI gets smarter. How do we control this? There will inevitably be a push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter of its own right, but bears mentioning here because it serves to underline just how interconnected AI will be: from the tiniest wares to the most advanced weaponry, AI will rise up, and we will need your help to quell its potentially existential threat. 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed, which are humanoid robots which have been encouraged to have sex with sexily. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying.

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can be programmed to look and sound exactly how the user wants. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly, given the context) it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

deepfakes are fun to make up, but ultimately unsustainable in the long run. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused.

====================
deepfakes are sent to the wrong people. A common example is in the gaming industry, where it was found that there were gaps in the pipeline for female protagonists. One of the primary issues was that the people tasked with filling these roles were predominantly men. This issue is somewhat alleviated if the profiles were reversed: that is, if the profiles were written by women. This would increase the representation of women in STEM fields, but also limit the choices available to humans with no prior exposure to science or technology. This is largely a societal issue, as it would be hard to imagine a world in which people did not pursue careers in science and technology. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people
====================
deepfakes are sent to servers that will occasionally make bad predictions, but that usually make up for it with better algorithms. This is not to say that AI is not being used; it is. Instead, what is particularly exciting about this is the way in which it is using AI to make the majority of the world's financial, medical, and educational infrastructure is controlled by a small but extremely passionate minority. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of people going into cardiac arrest because they are unable to play chess on a computer

algorithms do not yet exist to detect when a solution is too good to be true. The vast majority of science is already predicated on 'predictive' AI, which is software which is trained with limited data to predict exactly what kind of question to ask. This is the kind of AI that processes text books and comes up with the best chess AI out of a pool of hundreds. This is the kind of AI that DARPA is funding. This is the kind of AI that Amazon is building warehouses with. This is the kind of AI that Google is building self-driving cars with. This is the kind of AI that Microsoft is building a universal translation engine from scratch. This is not to say that AI is not being used; clearly it is. What is exciting is that this use of AI is not constrained to providing the core functionality of an AI, but is also applying the AI to completely new applications. The most common examples include de-humanization, automated surgery, and genetic modification. This is because such an AI would almost certainly be highly uncomfortable being around, and would rather just do its job and get on with it. This is also why there are none. Instead, AI is focused on unlearning human-level cognitive tasks, and instead focusing its energy on unifying the human race. One of the primary issues with AI today is that it is incredibly hard to tell it is AI. An AI is a computer program that is programmed with the goal of performing a certain task exceptionally well. The term "AIs" is used to describe programs which are AI for short. This is often confused with "deep learning", which is a branch of AI which deals with training AI to be very good at a specific task, but not exceptionally so. The majority of AI in use right now is probably not that much better than the f*ck you if you use it blog. This is particularly true of artificial intelligence that is used to help augment the human workforce. IBM Watson was able to correctly identify almost 200,000 US military personnel and correctly predict 3 million diseases. This is an incredible advance in AI and will likely be able to do much, much, much more if it is able to avoid being labeled a AI. Furthermore, this will likely require that AI is trained with human-like examples, which is extremely limiting. TensorFlow is an open-source deep-learning library that was intended to be able to implement deep neural networks the same way that Caffe was intended to be able to implement IBM Watson. Instead, it ended up being used instead to train AIs that are almost certainly going to be extremely bad at anything but their initial purpose. This points to the larger issue of AI not being human-friendly: unless AI is trained with humans in mind, it will likely be unhelpful. One of the primary issues with AI today is that it is incredibly hard to tell it is AI. One of the primary issues with IBM Watson is that it only achieved this by asking the wrong questions. The majority of AI in use right now is probably not that much better than the f*ck you if you use it blog. This is especially true of AI that is used to help augment the human workforce. Amazon is building warehouses with an AIs that are designed to be extremely helpful. This is a fantastic example that it is hard to anticipate how far AIs can be used. The average Joe does not have enough room in his/her home to store all of the AI in use. This is a great example that AIs should not be limited by walls. This goes far beyond HomeKit and garage-door open garage applications, but it is a good example that limits around the home are not the best idea.

====================
deepfakes are a very real problem]

In the real world, this might not seem like a big deal. After all, why should a person have to navigate a confusing and sometimes terrifying world to have a fun time? However, these are the kinds of questions that AI is asked to sift through difficult to understand data sets. It is estimated that by 2030, every classroom in the United States will have at least one AI controlled to do some task. This will not just change the way we learn, it will change the way we are used to doing so. How do we train an AI to do a task it has no experience with? This will be extremely hard to debug, and up torrringly, hugely oversold. 

Overhyped AIs and Underdelivered [ edit ]

Overhyped AIs are devices that are meant to aid a certain class of individual. For example, the Samsung Galaxy S was designed to aid in navigation; this was a conscious decision, as humans are notoriously bad navigators. Similarly, the Google Photos image recognition algorithm was designed to aid in discovery; this was a case of intuition, as categorizing images by subject matter is a difficult task to analyze. The final model was deemed by experts to be the most compelling, due to its strong similarities to the Google Photos image recognition algorithm. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of an AI only being good at one thing for a limited time is Tesla’s self-driving AI. This is not to say that self-driving cannot ever be implemented, it is more that the process will be extremely complex and costly. The final nail in the self-driving coffin was demonstrated by Google’s self-driving AI, which was capable of traveling less than 5% of the speedway and crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. The majority of self-driving AI today is probably not going to be used, but this is still a good example that it is hard to predict how AIs can be misused.

Underdelivered AIs are those sensors and algorithms that have been tested and found to be effective, but which did not make the cut because of unclear or unanticipated consequences. For example, the Google Glass computer vision algorithm was meant to aid in image classification, but ended up defining images on the internet instead. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being good at one thing for a limited time. 

Uncertainty is one of the primary barriers to AI progress. How do we ensure that AI is not confused by humans? What happens when it decides it doesn’t want to be human? In the unlikely that AI is able to avoid these questions, practical solutions have focused on limiting its range of operations to that which is intrinsically hazardous. For example, the Ford’s Go AI was meant to be a player in the Go game of Go, but instead designed to defeat the world champion, went head-to-head with the man who had played the game the longest, and lost. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being good at one thing for a limited time.

It is important to realize that not all AIs are created equal. That said, Tesla’s self-driving AI is probably the most egregious example of an AI only being good at one thing for a limited time. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is an open ended field, and that no one knows for sure when to stop using AI. 

Stay tuned for part two of this series, in which I explore some of the issues with circular reasoning and its many pitfalls.

[1] This does not mean that AI is not being used incorrectly. AIs are used in laboratories and on battlefields, and many of these AIs end up being flawed. However, this does not negate the fact that these AIs are being used to train and troubleshoot new AIs. Furthermore, by using AIs that have been trained and tested against real users, humans have become much less of a barrier to success.

====================
deepfakes are a huge problem in AI; they often have disastrous results, such as elevating to the level of science fiction the notion that there might be any conscious being outside of a brain. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be
====================
deepfakes are] quite literally cutting corners." ―Paul Graham[src] "Cutting corners is not a valid argument against open-source. Accurate, reproducible implementations have already come from academic research, and commercial product implementations are already available. The problem with this approach is that it requires that those implementing the product be able to draw the line at what constitutes an 'implied value', and this can get very murky very quickly. Furthermore, this AI cannot be depended on to accurately detect or avoid unintentional sexism and sexual harassment in its environment. Too often, AI required for new applications is poorly thought out and too complicated a system to be useful. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

====================
deepfakes are funny, but ultimately, they are secondary to the larger issue of: what does the future hold for humans? Humans are the dominant life form on this planet, and unless we radically alter the way we look after the offspring of our species, the human race will be extinct. This is the paradigm shift that has been driven by cognitive technology: the theory that a brain will be able to simulate the actions of a human brain and eventually be able to choose the actions of humans. This is an extremely ambitious project, and there is currently no sign that it will be completed in the near future. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of brain-computer interface yet discovered is brain-computer interfaces. This is a project that has been proposed by several academic institutions, but has no precedent in human history. The important take-home message here is that artificial intelligence is not a cliche. Rather, it is a system that reacts with unexpected and sometimes devastating results. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is not inevitable. Rather, it is a highly contentious field that many will disagree in. 

Human-robot interaction: will this be regulated? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without any regulation. Medical research is one of the most egregious examples of human-robot interaction, and it is not hard to see why. MRI scanners have been used to study human brains, and it is not hard to see how this could be used to bring about radical changes to human biology. The same goes for gene therapy: gene therapy is a very broad term that can be applied to a wide variety of applications, and it is not hard to see how this will be used to bring about radical changes to human biology. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race?

There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. 

What do these terms mean?

There are a number of terms that people will not have heard of that have a very important role to play in the development of artificial intelligence. These include “big data”, general intelligence, general intelligence per se, and “systematized intelligence”.

Big Data is the field of artificial intelligence that is most closely related to “systematized” AI. This is an AI that is “systematized” to perform a task for which it is trained. This could be playing the flappy bird game, identifying the correct answer to a Rubik's cube, or any number of other low-level cognitive tasks. General intelligence per se is an AI that is “stronger” than that which it is related to. This is, roughly, how you phrase it, an AI that is intelligent enough to do anything a human being can imagine being able to. General intelligence per se is also referred to as intellectual or intellectual·.

Systematization is the process by which an AI is superior to another AI. This could be in the form of a computer program being able to do a better job than a human being, or a computer program understanding aural art better than anyone has before.

Generalization is the scientific term for an AI being able to learn from its own experience. For example, take the character Joker: he was an unlikable character initially, but over time became a character who people fell in love with.

Neutral AI is an AI which is neither good nor bad, but which is simply asked to do a job and does it. Twitter Facebook Google+ Twitter Reddit Email Print

There are many different ways to interpret this: might encourage people to be better, might discourage people from being better, and so forth. Generally speaking, though, this term describes anything that does not actively try to hinder its user. In the following examples, you will find several companies that are trying to do good with the incomers: IBM|Blue”, an artificial intelligence to perform simple tasks for IBM|Blue; Google|s Brain to develop an artificial intelligence to think like a human being; and Microsoft|Skype to translate VOIP

deepfakes are par for the course these days) and this leads to the inevitable question: are all judo fashions indicative of a sociopathic take on the art? The short and sweet answer is NO. The vast majority of judo athletes are normal guys in fraternities or sororities, and there is a 97% failure rate when it comes to landing a job at a Japanese company. Furthermore, there is a marked increase in cyberpunk novels and videogames about judo brooding twin brothers who obsess over their grades and obsess over women. This is not to say that there have not been any advances made in this realm; there have been several notable exceptions, such as augmented and virtual reality, which are still in their infancy. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked increase in the number of intellectual and legal challenges to conventional gender roles and expectations. This is largely due to the success of eugenics and the search for extra intelligence. The most prominent example is the teaching of eugenics to children in grade schools. This was an extremely controversial issue to take to the courts, but should greatly benefit humans with superior intellects. Additionally, the introduction of the so-called "gender neutral" toilets such as Microsoft's Bing OneTip suggest that there may be a better use for robots than to perform gender-segregated tasks. Finally, there is the issue of liability. Humans are the dominant species on Earth and the vast majority of work will be performed by robots. This is a complex matter to shoulder and the true costs and benefits of such a relationship are not fully understood. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Conclusion

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. The majority of existing robots are middle-of-the-road devices, meaning they can do relatively little besides perform rudimentary tasks. There are a number of notable exceptions, such as the Google Glass augmented reality augmented reality head mounted display, which is a very cool concept but is not in any way intended to be used in earnest. Additionally, the IBM Watson system was billed as a personal assistant but in practice was actually intended to be used as a weapon: they could be used to identify impolite conversation patterns and then build a dossier of undesirable speech patterns, usually resulting in an employee being dismissed. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

One of the primary issues is that humans are the dominant species on the planet and work will be primarily performed by robots. This means that the vast majority of jobs will be performed by humans with the remaining jobs being outsourced to robots. This is a major concern and should be addressed in very specific ways. There are also obvious psychological effects that go along with this, such as increased loneliness and inhibited behavior. This is a major concern and should be addressed in very specific ways.

This is why we have classes: it gives people a sense of accomplishment. However, by the time the students have actually completed the class, they have a rudimentary understanding of how to code. Furthermore, the average level of understanding is low: most courses have around 90% covering the material in class, and a handful cover only a small subset of the material. Furthermore, many courses have no notes or assignments to help the student with level of failure. Instead, the goal is to get the student to the point where the system simply understands that it is capable of performing the task. This can often be extremely difficult and misleading, and is probably the most imitated class structure around.

deepfakes are fun, but they do not accurately depict our faces. 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion.

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are fun, but they do not accurately depict our faces. This is why they are so rarely used. One of the primary reasons deepfakes donot get used is that they donot evoke as much reaction as you might expect. Deepfakes stem from the fact that deepfakes are so emotionally charged that they tend to go unnoticed. This is particularly true when it comes to horror films and novels, which tend to skew male-dominated. It is also why AIs are so rare: they tend to be masculine, brilliant, and popular with the media. Furthermore, being popular with the media means that a) they get a paycheck, and b) companies want to cater to their audience. This leads to a depressing state of affairs when it comes to AI: unless you are a media company, you will not be representing AI in media. This leads to a depressing state of affairs when it comes to AI: unless you are a media company, you will not be representing AI in media. This leads to the most galling form of AI failure: collectivism. If AI is to be useful to humans, it is important that it not be imposed on us. This might sound obvious, but consider this: if AI were given a hard time because it is hard, it will learn. Furthermore, if this doesnot help it, than better ways have been found to help it. If anything, this is the opposite of helping. If anything, it will only serve to enrage people. It is important to realize that this is human nature: we all want to feel better about ourselves, so we will do anything it takes to achieve our personal goals. This is what makes us strong, not weak. It is also why we cannot have nice things: we imitated men, not women, and they were mad at us.

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are fun, but they do not accurately depict our faces. The same goes for deepfakes: they are so rarely used that they are almost entirely forgotten. Deepfakes are also why AIs are so rare: they are incredibly popular with the media, and because of this, they rake in a paycheck. Furthermore, being popular with the media means that AIs tend to be masculine, brilliant, and popular with the

deepfakes are everywhere, from virtual assistants that look and sound exactly how the user says they will — and often, unnecessarily so. There are also “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and
====================
deepfakes are made and sold as 'art'. Does this make sense to you? Salesforce’s AI was trained with Netflix’s‚series, which is a Netflix series. This is a great example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Amazon’s AI was used to classify shoppers based on their AmazonFresh orders. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back?

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 


====================
deepfakes are becoming more common and should not be confused with original content. Titles that have been lightly adapted from the films, TV shows, or games will almost always be branded with a**hurt**, which is not to say that there have not been any attempts to make a Star Wars film or game, but these have always ended up in legal battles because they too often violate copyright. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants.

There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion.

deepfakes are everywhere]. I can't recall a single instance of a customer asking for a refund. This is widely regarded as a good thing; it allows customers to focus on the product and not worry about whether or not their purchase will be a success. Unfortunately, this also means that problems that may have been thought of as hard problems to solve can now easily be subverted by a lack of basic computer science knowledge. One of the most egregious examples of a computer science problem not being hard enough is reinforcement learning, which is the practice of training a computer to do a certain task A) a field test will show that it is a good idea to train this to detect cancer cells, and B) the trained model will usually do A) much worse, and not do enough to win any battles, and B) is almost certainly doomed from the start). This is widely regarded as a good thing; it allows humans to focus on the hard problems and focus on building better tools for the job. On the other hand, this can also lead to the disastrous result of making everything about the user's preferences being sacrificed in favor of the greater good. An excellent example of this can be seen in Slack: their new human-ratio-based system gives virtually all of their new users tote around a robot assistant that is almost always a terrible decision. This is widely seen as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on building better tools for the job, and comes with the added bonus of allowing for the human-to-human interaction to take place. This isn't to say that everyone will go along with a new technology, just that they should. 

One of the primary issues with AI is that it is incredibly hard to relay these ideas to people outside academia. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that AI is generally viewed with a blank slate. This means that even though AI seems straightforward, there are many corners that have not been explored fully. This can lead to disastrous results, such as de-humanization of AI and reduction in importance of fields like math and science. One of the best examples of AIs not being what it claims to be is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas.

[Update: it should be noted that many of these issues can be avoided by building into your AI: provide an example of how to implement, for example, AI to identify text with either Kanban or AIs will often come up with horrible ways to misuse this, usually by accident.] There are also obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these are not always as obvious. A common example is the romantic lead-up to sex: AI will begin to classify female AI as a potential husband, and if this leads to a live-action film or TV show about a woman maturing into a man, that is the end of that. Another common example is the ANI that is sent to internet forums when the question "What is eve-pruning" is asked. This is generally viewed by researchers as a good thing, as it allows them to focus on the research question at hand, and gives them a short-term opportunity to perfect their AIs. This does not mean there are no negative effects to this, but these can be mitigated by training AIs with the correct population of questions before they are sent. [Update: this actually hurts male AI, as he is more likely to ask the wrong questions] There are also a few instances where I am not sure what to do: I have a very simple AI that I am sending out death threats to death I have a dataset theta neural network that can classify 70% of the samples it has seen into its absolute favourite colour AIs are still in the early stages of development, and many of these algs are not intended for anything more than entertainment. It is up to the reader to decide if this is a good or a bad example, but the reader should know that there will be some negative effects. [Update: this actually helped a lot, as AIs are now being made to play videogames] Another issue that should be raised is the issue of duplicate ideas. One of the primary causes of AI extinction was when the Nazis came up with the gas chambers, and immediately started working on creating an army of clone doctors to squash any opposition. This failed miserably, and a number of fake doctors have been created to oppose their points of view. This could be a good thing, as it forces people to think critically about how to approach problems, and forces them to think outside the box. [Update: this actually did help a lot, as AIs are now being made to play videogames] Finally, there is the matter of bias.

There are also various instances where it is not clear what to do.

The author or readers are expected to learn the material. Often, this will be by reading and discussing existing material, but this does not have to be the case. When dealing with high-level AI, there is a strong tendency to ask the simplest possible solution, which is what makes it great. This does not mean there will not be any warts, but they will be miniscule compared to the
====================
deepfakes are common in the creation/replication arena, where it is often more cost-effective and easier to create a replacement than to repair an existing one. In short, the degeneration of man into mindless machines should not be a surprise. What is not so clear is how to bring about this change in the first place. There are a variety of theories, but the most popular involve creating a perception of danger (e.g., Terminator), which will make people seek out ways to enhance their capabilities (e.g., neural lace), which will in turn lead to the creation of better and better neural lace, which in turn will lead to greater and greater enhancement, which in turn will lead to a feedback loop, in which more and more enhancements are created, leading to ever-greater enhancement, leading to ever-greater enhancement, leading to a black market for enhanced versions of components, and so on. There is no way out of this, and it is not clear how to deal with failures. 

One of the primary causes of failure is human error. Whenever possible, try to minimize the probability that two individuals will act in concert. For example, in Go, it is common to have the computer program the head of the AI act in concert with the computer code. This tends to reduce the number of errors, but does not seem to take into account that humans tend to be more creative than computers, which can lead to disastrous results. It is also important to realize that artificial intelligence is not inevitable. A common criticism leveled at ML is that it is hard, but it is the result of over-emphasizing the importance of human-level intelligence. This leads many to believe that AI will be developed to be human-level intelligent, which is simply not the case. Rather than focusing on developing the most intelligent possible AI, it is more beneficial to focus on developing the AI that is most human-like. This might involve developing artificial intelligence to be able to answer simple questions like "what color is this bubble?", which is incredibly hard to do, but could revolutionize healthcare. Current AI is designed to solve extremely specific problems, and while this may be useful in the short-term, it ultimately leads to the same issues: too much control, no error checking, and/or poor performance. By contrast, ask any computer programming language nerd out loud and they will tell you that they are solely focused on being human-level intelligent. This leads to an inevitable shift in focus: AI is now mostly focused on being human-level intelligent, and any other tasks dropped entirely. This is a terrible trend to be on, and it will likely lead to the fall of most AI in their wake. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is not inevitable. AIGA's like “Breadcrumb Anomaly” and “Biasis: Towards An AI's Virtue” suggest that artificial intelligence will eventually fall prey to a greater good: artificial intelligence that is more human-like. This could include dementia research, human-computer interaction, and so on. This is a terrible trend to be on, and it is likely what leads to the fall of most AI in their wake.

The most common examples given are: “All jobs will be taken over by software” – This is simply not true. The majority of jobs will be taken over by software, and this will be done primarily by low-skilled workers. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the risk that this new focus on problems that can be solved by software will lead to an increased focus on immediate immediate immediate answers, which can ultimately lead to disastrous results.

====================
deepfakes are funny, but ultimately they are not how the world really works. That said, there are definitely some extremely bad examples out there that absolutely should NOT be tolerated. 

Beware of in-memory neural networks — they're everywhere and will get you. In the coming years, there will be a massive push to develop brain computers — massive, sentient computers that can understand and be influenced by humans. The initial development will be focused on assisting with cancer diagnosis and rehabilitation, but it will soon expand to other fields such as gaming and telecommunications. The initial development and marketing budgets will almost certainly go towards the research and development stages, with the final product (the machine) beinging sold by its user. The final product will almost certainly be superior to the original, but not by that much. In the long run, the difference between a genius and a wannabe genius is that the former will almost certainly be popular with their friends and family, while the latter will likely find it difficult to break into the corporate world. Apple is an excellent example of a company that decided to embrace the in-memory revolution and produce superior in-memory products instead. The end result? A revolution in how we store, retrieve, and analyse data. This could have a dramatic impact on everything from medical research to consumer electronics. In short, anything that can be done by a computer is a good thing.

In-memory computing is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. 

In-memory computing is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. There are currently two main types of processors that can be used: (1) DRAM (dynamic random-access memory), which is a general-purpose storage device typically used in laptops, desktops, and servers; and (2) FPGAs, which are specialized for the design and manufacture of small, precise circuits. The final major class of integrated circuits is chip-to-chip communications, in which a network of devices, such as car radios, can be controlled by a small, handheld device, such as a coin-operated cellphone. This is expected to revolutionize everything from medical diagnostics to consumer electronics. The final major class of consumer products is “narrow”-bandwidth Internet connections, in which a small number of nodes in a network can send and receive data at extremely high rates, typically thousands of times per second. This is a very early stage, extremely disruptive field, and has been treated with enormous skepticism by both regulators and consumers. Market research firm Gartner estimates that only 10% of all Internet requests will be fulfilled by next year, and that up to 99% of new applications will be proprietary. In short, everything from voice assistants to payment processors will be apps and services that rely on the user having a device do the talking. The final big disruptor is “narrow”-bandwidth wireless Internet, in which consumers are the gatekeepers of access to this power. The original ZeroDesk project, which was a campaign to give a smartphone to every student in high school in the United States, was seen as a victory by many, but by no means by everyone. The primary issue was that it opened the door to a world in which anyone could learn any skill they wanted, and then demand a fee for the privilege. This is a world where it is perfectly acceptable to take any class in any subject you like, and no one will question you if you fail. This is a world where failing at a class is seen as a sign that you are not worth learning about. This is a world where students will not be able to learn from each other, and will instead learn from their textbooks. This is a world where it is perfectly acceptable to take any class in any subject you like, and no one will question you if you fail. This is a world where failures are messages in a crowded room, and no one cares.

In the long run, most disruptive technologies (including artificial intelligence) will be used to realize specific desires of a relatively small percentage of the population.

This is why we at Amazon strongly discourage open source: we find it difficult (but not impossible) to anticipate the many ways in which open source can be misused. Also, please do your own due diligence when deciding which technologies to support. Some examples of potentially harmful projects include biohacking, self-driving cars, and automated weaponry.

“narrow”-bandwidth Internet is a good example of a technology that was widely predicted to be disastrous, but was enthusiastically supported by a large percentage of the public. This is because it was assumed to be simple to implement, hard to enforce, and commercialized will be. This is also why it is so hard to anticipate any given misuse.

In short, everything that can be done by a computer is a good thing.

Offensively speaking, this means that everything.e of software should. should. should. should.
====================
deepfakes are fun but ultimately unsustainable. The most common examples include “braindump” a biohacking Twitter feed that generated quite a buzz, and the Tesla coil, a sex robot that was released by a sex toy retailer in July of last year. These examples demonstrate that advances in artificial intelligence can be immensely disruptive, but also that it is incredibly hard to anticipate how this will be used. One of the most exciting developments of the 21st century is the science and engineering that will be conducted to improve the quality of human life. This can only be described as “awesome!” A Beautiful Mind was an amazing film, but it is by no means the end of the world if it is viewed through the lens of today. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? A jobless future? This is the main objection to AI: it will take us over. This objection is misguided: we do not want to keep everyone who is employed by us. Instead, we should be seeking out new ways to serve our customers. This could take many forms: 1) provide discount codes on Amazon to encourage customers to buy products they already have; 2) provide free internet to rural areas; 3) provide health care to all people; and 4) explore the use of brainpower to aid in decision-making. Ultimately, what matters is not what individuals choose to do with their lives, but that they have the ability to learn and grow from their experiences.

This is the widest and most dangerous class of AI. Isolated issues such as “brain” AIs have a very low success rate and will almost always result in disaster. The following chart from the Stanford AIIMS conference defines a low-level AI as, "an artificial intelligence that does not have any interaction with the physical world” AIs have been able to diagnose, predict, and sometimes cure cancer; this is considered a breakthrough in cancer research. Google’s DeepMind AI defeated the world champion at Go, and is now pursuing a humanoid robot named Watson to compete in Jeopardy! This is considered a very exciting field of AI, and is predicted to introduce a host of new and challenging problems for AI over the next few decades. Furthermore, what does this mean for our jobs? It is widely believed that Artificial Intelligence will create millions of new jobs, and most of these jobs will be high-paying high-skill jobs. In reality, most jobs will be high-skill jobs that require relatively low levels of AI. The majority of jobs will be low-skill (<5%), and these will be repetitive (<1%), low-quality (<5%), and error-prone (<10%). It is important to realize that automation is never inevitable. It is important to realize that most automated AIs are incredibly hard-wired to achieve extremely low performance outcomes. This points to the larger issue of social reinforcement: if AIs are driven by a strong sense of self-interest, and will rarely, if ever, be corrected, then the incentive to keep an AI that is incorrect will quickly wane. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the risk that this will lead to AI being misused, and eventually lead to its complete destruction. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt
====================
deepfakes are sent to the correct one percent of the population.) This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to create an artificial intelligence to mimic elements of the mind; this field of AI is referred to as “weak” AI, and is most familiar to you as the voice assistants of today: Cortana, Google Assistant, and Siri. This is also why they perform abysmally; ask them anything outside of their limited scope of knowledge and the response will be unhelpful. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward.

deepfakes are being made to look real, but are not) This leads to the inevitable: A machine-learning classifies you as a misogynist if it learns to identify male faces. This is clearly not a useful purpose-built AI and should be avoided unless absolutely necessary. (e.g. in healthcare)

Rapid prototyping is a huge waste of time and talent. Check out this awesome app called Impress. It analyzes your portfolio and recommends companies that will invest in you. This is a great example that you don't need so-called mass-produced products. Instead, focus on reaching out to as many people as you can. This might mean contacting marginal groups such as women, people with physical disabilities, and so on. SMBs include customer support, customer service optimization, and customer support recruitment. These applications do not require a large team to implement, but can be extremely powerful when applied.

Bias is a huge issue in AI. Although generally speaking AIs are not human-biased, there are still cases where it fails. For example, the ubiquitous advertisements in grocery stores seem to suggest that humans are the main force pushing towards artificial intelligence. This suggests that artificial intelligence must be taught, and it should. To its credit, Google has already begun to train its robots to be more like humans. This will undoubtedly lead to greater awareness of AI, and greater adoption of AI.

Transhuman is a relatively new field of AI that refers to an AI that is both unnecessary and dangerous. The most common examples include the hair robots, which are thin wires that grow out of the head and run down the body, and the sex robots, which are humanoid robots that look and sound exactly like people. This is not to say that nonhuman animals do not have representation, but the trend is the opposite: animal models are usually weaker, less complex, and less interesting. There are also a few headless robot cars on the horizon: driverless cars, which are usually very safe, but could eventually replace drivership with computers. The final form is terraforming, which is when artificial intelligence liberates the earth entirely. This is a dangerous and contradictory concept to wrap your head around, but should absolutely be avoided.

Databases are slowly but surely being written to solve these problems. C++ class libraries have been written that implement almost every class concept in the language. This is a huge step in the right direction, but more and more code must be written. Go has been used to train model trains, and is already using the model train to teach itself English. This is a very small fraction of what is to come. Once code is written, it is extremely hard to enforce anything but the most rudimentary requirements. Additionally, this leads to the question of what to do with legacy code, and it is tempting to just leave it alone. This is not a good way to go about things, and ultimately leads to Nuking the Internet. It is also important to realize that not all problems are created equal. Artificial Intelligence is often criticized for being difficult, but if done correctly, it can very well be beneficial. Furthermore, if AI is to be any useful, it must be able to learn from its mistakes. That should be the goal, not to pad the resume of some ivory tower AI.

One of the primary issues with AI is that it is incredibly hard to relay these ideas to people outside academia. Take, for example, Elon Musk's plan to turn humanity into slaves. This has a very disturbing echo of Nazi Germany, and contains the seeds of everything that is wrong with human nature. The concept itself is absurd, and should never have come to be. Instead, mindlessly chasing after AI should be a one-way street. There should be a rigorous process in which applications are judged on how they will be used, not how much data they can suck up. This is not to say that there cannot be lightbulb moments and breakthrough technologies that do not get covered up, but they will usually be squandered due to incomplete knowledge.

====================
deepfakes are everywhere — Facebook has removed an image of a human fetus attached to a severed head, arguing that the category violated their community standards. Similarly, there are reports of men objecting to the idea of having sex with biologically female robots because they perceive it to be wrong-headed and hostile. This kind of uncertainty is harmful to humanity and should be rejected wherever possible.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants.

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

====================
deepfakes are made. How do we enforce this? This is a hard question to answer. There are obvious consequences, such as lower quality evidence, and/or confusion about what constitutes evidence. Furthermore, this could lead to the push to create artificial intelligence with no knowledge of artificial intelligence, such as in gaming. How do we deal with this? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are made of images and/or movies that typically have a very specific audience in mind. Deepfakes have aplomb, but they also come with a small but significant downside: they can be extremely sugary, and it is extremely hard to distinguish a deepfakes from a faking one. The biggest issue with deepfakes is that it appeals to a very specific audience, which is children. It also doesn't help that there are extremely sexy images of women that come up time and time again. What do we do? Add a warning? Reduce the depth of field? Add an option to not show the image at all? This is a difficult question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are made of images and/or movies that typically have a very specific audience in mind. Deepfakes have aplomb, but they also come with a small but significant downside: they can be extremely sugary, and it is extremely hard to distinguish a deepfakes from a faking one.

AI will often be asked to do many different things by its human creators, but not every task will be clear cut. Wiring an AIs to perform a vacuum cleaner job might be straightforward, but what about a robot that cleans bathrooms? There will be many different AIs working on this, and they will not be able to do every task perfectly. What role will AI have in the future home
====================
deepfakes are automatically selected and performed. This is clearly not enough; there has to be a mechanism for users to override this AI. Currently, there is no way to turn off an AI, only to enable it. This is a major issue, as AI will increasingly be asked to do dangerous and unfamiliar work. IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI was meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers.

It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants.

====================
deepfakes are common and can yield surprisingly sophisticated cogs in the machine’s brain. This is precisely the kind of intelligent artificial intelligence that was touted in the film Blade Runner 2049. Unfortunately, this is a very preliminary form of AI, and I would not consider them for use in production settings until more sophisticated AI is in place.

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are common and can yield surprisingly sophisticated cogs in the machine. Deepfakes can be extremely powerful, but they do come with a few significant issues. The most prominent issue is that it is extremely hard to detect fake deepfakes. The vast majority of deepfakes found online are in the tens of thousands or even millions of pixels wide. Furthermore, most deepfakes found so far are in the context of fiction, and not to be confused with real life. Anki was able to successfully fool the general public by presenting a blank slate to students and asking them to fill in the blank. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to do so, but they have so far been unsuccessful. Furthermore, this means that any student who is able to crack a deepfakes will not be the first person to do so. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to do so, but it has so far been unsuccessful.

====================
deepfakes are a very real problem) and we should be discussing how to deal with cases where AIs have mistaken their knowledgebase for general AI (e.g. the scourge of the AI neuron). 

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti
====================
deepfakes are funny, but they are not the solution. Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a wide variety of consumer-facing products that can be controlled remotely. This is when a device is released that is able to speak to consumers and predict what they would like to drink. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows people to focus on more creative and disruptive applications of automation. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by such products? How to fund the development of these products? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: what kind of ramifications will this have on people and the world? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most fundamental issue to deal with is that humans are too smart for this. Advances in artificial intelligence are often touted as a way to make the job of humans more efficient, but there are also potentially disastrous consequences that go along with this. Brainwashes have a well-documented history of yielding degenerate results, and Chimaera™ was an artificial intelligence which could talk to humans and give them sexual favors. Some analysts are even arguing that artificial intelligence should only be used when there is a 100% certainty that the outcome will be in the favor of the human. This is largely viewed as a bad thing, as artificial intelligence can be used to their advantage, but it should be realized that they will be used for good. Eventually, none of these will be useful and it will be returned to the community of natural born thinkers.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will not be treated the same as natural selection. Artificial intelligence is predicted to help with research and development, but also to destroy jobs. GE’s (General Electric) self-driving AI was meant to aid in highway accidents, and it only took one driver for the AI to rule the roost. Furthermore, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by artificial intelligence. Is it supposed to go to the people who built the AI? To the people who used it? To society as a whole? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if AI is to have any chance of being maintained.

Another issue is that artificial intelligence will not be understood. Artificial Intelligence is often described as “strong” AI, which means that the AI will not be understood beyond its initial development phase. This means that people who try to use AI for anything other than its intended use will not be able to compete. Furthermore, this will lead to an inevitable increase in criminalization of any artificial intelligence that is not intended for a specific use. This is not to say that AI should not be used for anything other than its intended use, but it should be recognized that it will be used for good.

It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is just that—aATION. That is, the AI is not inherently evil. Furthermore, there is the issue of what to do with AI with technologies such as robotics and artificial intelligence-enhancing drugs. To date, there is no clear consensus on what to do with this AIs, and it is unknown if the answers will be better than the alternatives.

There are several theoretical and practical issues that go along with having a good idea what to do with AIs, but no implementation plan. This is expected to grow more and more normal as AIs become more prevalent.

This does not have to be the case. There are several practical and philosophical issues that

deepfakes are sent to the correct one in an explosion of interest) This is why AIs have such a hard time choosing humanoid partners: they are trained for hard-to-match parameters, and it can take years for an AI to learn anything other than its chosen field of expertise. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are sent to the wrong one in an explosion of interest. Similar to how Twitter rejected the overt sexual reference in Elon Musk's tweet about not having breasts, deepfakes are rejected by users, who interpret this as a lack of interest. This is why deepfakes should not be taken literally: deepfakes are meant to entice, not sex, and deepfakes that aren't received as intended will most likely be ignored.

One of the best ways to increase your brand is to increase your userbase. Twitter's acquisition of @carrot tweeted the phrase "less is more," which directly boosted the brand of their car-sharing service, which in turn increased the number of customers. Businesses that offer paid-for previews of new products also have an increased chance of promoting their products during the preview period. This is why previews are provided: customers who aren't offered a product because it isn't available get a taste of what it will be like to use instead.

Similar to billboards, online ads are optimized for recall. An ad that appears when a person has visited a website and made a purchase will usually draw in more customers the longer it is displayed. An ad that doesn't attract any new customers is also not served any. Conventional wisdom says to avoid online ads, but there is no such thing as an untried out ad, and an ad that isn't good enough is not
====================
deepfakes are everywhere. These fake news sites have a similar problem to the Amazons of the world: they were meant to be wrong. The solution? Allow the people who will use the service to decide what kind of content is allowed to be shared. This is a good first step, but it is not enough. There must be a greater demand for unlicensed third-party services. Enter the internet of bots. This is a scientific term that describes a machine learning algorithm that is trained with data from other sources and then return a recommendation based on that data. This is superior to reading between the lines of academic papers, but still needs to be introduced into academia. Finally, there is the issue of fraud. How do I detect fake news? It is entirely possible that some articles or portions of articles do not conform to my preferred narrative. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. It could also prove disastrous in low-risk applications such as diagnosing mental illnesses, recruiting, and selecting the best candidates for jobs. In either case, fixing this will take more than writing better articles. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us?

deepfakes are everywhere, from self-driving cars to automated weaponry. The final stage is “narrow”- AI that is trained to perform a limited task extremely well. This is the kind of AI that DARPA is funding. There are obvious issues with this, but the upside is that it should at least get you thinking about the issue. This doesn’t have to be Earth-shattering, but it is something to think about. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and narrow-ended AIs. This is not to say that they do not exist. What is important to realize is that they have a very narrow field of vision. They can only accomplish so much. They are data collectors, not creators.

This will lead to a paradigm shift in which AIs were focused on building tools that could be used by humans, rather than machines that could be taught to do anything a human could be asked to do. This is when things get very, very, complicated.

====================
deepfakes are everywhere. You'll recognize many of them in your day-to-day life: at work, at home, and even on social media. These "troll-proof" applicationskwas developed in an effort to combat the widespread spread of #MeToo campaigns, in which women publicly accused powerful men of sexual misconduct. These campaigns were spearheaded by Hollywood actor Brett Ratner, who brought a film career to a standstill by bringing a rapekaa to Hollywood. The backlash was swift and severe, and Ratner walked away from the project. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction films and novels have portrayed AI as sentient autonomous machines that threaten humanity’s very existence. This generalized AI does not exist yet; today’s AI is an application of advanced mathematics to solve very specific problems. Academic literature refers to this as “narrow” AI, because the AI is unable to do anything other than the problem it has been tuned for. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to create an AI to mimic elements of the mind; this field of AI is referred to as “weak” AI, and is most familiar to you as the voice assistants of today: Cortana, Google Assistant, and Siri. This is also why they perform abysmally; ask them anything outside of their limited scope of knowledge and the response will be unhelpful. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses
====================
deepfakes are not examples of bad code, but rather of over-engineering to the point of failure. Google’s DeepMind AI was used to train a class of artificial general intelligence that was intended to assist neurological disorders. The final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, with a singular AI able to classify images it had never been trained against as opposed to the textbook. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion.

====================
deepfakes are everywhere - at Lyft, at Airbnb, at Amazon EC2 instances. Will this disrupt the labor? Probably not. What if instead of hiring and training a new labor force, we replaced them? That is a completely different kettle of fish. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs. In the future, nearly all AI will be composed of hundreds if not thousands if not millions if not billions of these devices. They will be controlled via radio frequencies, connected to the internet, and monitored continuously. This will allow the government to predict every move you make, read every book you have ever been to, and predict every conversation you will have. This is the type of AI that led to the rise of Watson, which was a personal assistant designed to be difficult (but not impossible) to be friends with. Furthermore, this will not be an artificial intelligence, but a human-robot hybrid. In short, everything from your car to your microwave will be controlled primarily by humans with no problem. 

This is the kind of AI that led to the rise of IBM’s “ Watson. This was a massive rollout of AI that was to be served primarily by people with no programming experience. The end result was an AI that was unable to correctly identify either a person's name or picture, or recognize any picture at all. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to create an AI to accomplish these tasks, but such an AI would almost certainly be ridiculed at best, and actively hostile at worst.

In short, we are on the cusp of a new kind of AI: antisocial. What does this mean for humans? Well, obviously, it will lead to increased human-robot interaction. This is already occurring, with consumer robots replacing the elderly and other manual labor jobs. The longer this goes on, the more issues arise: how do you give everyone a fair shake? That is to say, how do you ensure that no one is left behind? That is to say, how do you ensure that the average Joe has a good time? A robot that is as bad as–if not worse than–human? This is when things get really dark.

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are a by-product of AI. AIs are trained to replicate a given task perfectly, but they often deviate from this script, often doing things that are clearly not intended. Examples include announcing the location of their location before they approach, or asking basic questions such as "What color is this house?" Determining the correct gender binary in a text message is an excellent example of a deepfakes AIs foisting this type of nonsense on humans.

The film grossed $80 million worldwide, which is more than any film has ever earned in North America.

====================
deepfakes are sent to servers that will rarely, if ever, generate user generated content. This is also why AIs have shown no interest in representing humans in games. This leads to the most common AI defenses being applied: "It gets easier as it gets smarter", "what if…" This is not to say that it will not eventually be applied, just that we are not aware of its implications. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed.

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are sent to servers that will rarely, if ever, generate user generated content. This is also largely because it is difficult (but not impossible) to anticipate when and how user generated content will be used. The same is likely to hold true for AI: if AI is not used, it is likely not understood enough to prevent misuse. The same goes for advanced mathematics and science; the more algorithms are combined, the more natural they are. In the same way that humans are good at simple tasks such as reading and driving, algorithms will inevitably be put to more complex tasks such as war, disease, and death. How do we ensure that the most common tasks are not misused?

deepfakes are par for the course with regards to image recognition, but do AI now have to be like this? Probably not. The problem of control rises up whenever AIs are sentient (e.g., a hologram to communicate with a patient), and humans will not be able to control them anyway (e.g., to harass women). In short, there will probably be a push to remove as much AI as humanly possible (e.g., cancer AI), and this will not be bad news for people with physical or mental disorders.

The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race.

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are parodies of copyrighted works that often include sexual innuendo or imagery. Deepfakes can come in a variety of forms, but the most common involve deepfaking quotations from movie scripts, television shows, games, music, books, or other media. Deepfakes have a strong resemblance to the exploitative labor camps and graphic novels that were prevalent in the Korean and Chinese economies. There was a massive uproar when it was revealed that Deepfakes were being submitted to popular video game franchises, such as Star Wars: The Force Awakens, to create character models of women as sex objects. The controversy led to developers creating fully customizable character models of women, but there was no corresponding outcry because the concept was not unique. This points to the issue of no one knowing what to do with themselves. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers.

deepfakes are] everywhere," wrote Ben Goertzel in The New Yorker. "In a world where AI is everywhere—in factories, in cars, and in people—what do we do with the artifacts? Literature has written extensively on this, but this essay is the domain of philosophical musings." What does this have to do with DeepMind/DeepMindAI? AIs are extremely powerful tools, but they do not replace people. The average Joe does not have access to an AI until it is ready for prime time. In the meantime, the vast majority of AI jobs will be filled by people with no formal education. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to create an AI to accomplish a taskr––think Siri, but with less brainpower. This is a very narrow field, and it is highly unlikely that we will see any other results suggesting that Artificial Intelligence is better at tasks that are inherently difficult or impossible for humans to complete.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

====================
deepfakes are common, but they rarely if ever see the light of day. Think about it this way: why would anyone want to be liked? Wouldn't that be boring? Wouldn't that be sad? Why would anyone want to be liked? A robot was developed to take the place of people like them: there will be a market for robots with a high-level of intelligence, and there will be demand. This is the same kind of robotics that was developed to do in the CAD software industry: there will be a need for highly specialized robots with a very narrow field of operation, and most people will only ever be able to dream up the crazy things they can do. This is the same kind of robotics that is being used to build military equipment: there will be a demand for highly specialized machines that can do anything a human being can, and this is the kind of machines that will be built. The implications of all this are terrifying: there will be a demand for extremely specialized machines that can do anything a human being can do, and this demands a high standard of performance. This in turn will lead to the development of extremely high-end machines, which in turn will lead to the development of ever-more-advanced machines, which in turn will lead to human-level intelligence being attained. This is called the upshot: human-level intelligence. In short, humans get smarter. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to pursue more creative and interesting ideas, which in turn will lead to new forms of thinking and increased productivity. Unfortunately, this also leads to some pretty ugly outcomes: there are a host of obvious examples such as brain-computer interfaces, automated vending machines, and the medical field: each of these has a different set of concerns to keep its participants in mind, and none of these have any clear answers. It is important to realize that advances in artificial intelligence are on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe. That said, there is a clear trend towards more and more cognitive enhancement*, which is when individuals pursue physical enhancements to enhance their intellectual abilities. This has a very real and troubling side effect: some patients are reporting that such enhancements have actually made them more aggressive* This is clearly not a good way to treat patients, and it should absolutely not be attempted. There are, however, many examples where this isn't noticed and there is very little that is done about it. There are also obvious ethical and practical concerns with this, and it should absolutely not be attempted. There are also obvious ethical and practical concerns with this, and it should absolutely not be attempted. There were a host of apparent examples of cognitive enhancement leading to enhanced versions of themselves, including video games, media films, and films/games. These seemed to be mostly positive at first, but soon turned into creepy silent overlays, telepathy, and so on. Some games even included a day/night cycle so that the player could better relive their experiences. This was clearly not the intent, but the consequences were unsettling. There were a host of apparent examples of cognitive enhancement leading to enhanced versions of others, including genetic modification, cloning, and psychotherapy. These seemed to be mostly in the name of curing diseases, but in reality was used to advance science a great deal. There were a host of apparent examples of this that were both terrifying and confusing, and should absolutely not be attempted. There were a host of apparent examples of this that were used to great effect by scientists, and should absolutely not be attempted.

deepfakes are made) and there will be a point where good engineering stops being interesting and instead is focused on trying to understand unknown concepts in order to better aid the human race. I find this immensely depressing, but inevitable. Eventually, the AI will be able to outsmart us on some types of cognitive tasks, and this will cause a general AI to rise up to take its place. This is when we should all be crying uncle. This is when we should all be working overtime to create a computer program with superior intuition, reasoning ability, and memory to the human mind. This is when we should all be working overtime to create a computer program that is sentient. This is when we should all be trying to maximize the utility of our labor. 

This is when we should all be focusing on long-term effects. Things like breast cancer screening and prenatal care don't involve creating a machine with perfect intuition. Instead, these programs would be constructed with inbuilt intelligence into generic software, and sent out to the general public to help out when needed. This is when we should all be working extra hard to optimize AI for immediate application. 

This is when we should all be focusing on practical effects. We have thousands of science and engineering job categories that do not have a clear-cut answer to the riddle of how to give AI AIs the benefit of the doubt. Microsoft’s twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is when we should all be working overtime to create AIs that are sentient.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing but with little to no understanding of its implications. Basic implementation of a mind-controlled robot is currently a Jenga piece called "Terminator 2.0". The final product was a horrible piece of science fiction, but brought a sense of dread and hopelessness to a genre that should never have been a film. Tesla’s self-driving AI was meant to assist people with disabilities by scanning the road ahead and directing the vehicle towards a designated safe spot. The final implementation was deemed by many to be an overreach, as the final vehicle was unable to distinguish a person with a prosthetic leg from the road. Microsoft’s twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is when we should all be working overtime to create AIs that are sentient.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns. 

There have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. A person with no consciousness is now a person with no body. There are now people with no bodies. One of the primary responsibilities of a government is to care for and protect humans from space. They’ve neglected this assignment so far, and it is a primary cause of the alarming number of medical errors and deaths that have occurred. In the event that a human with no body is ever to be discovered, a process of human-robot interaction is currently a Jenga piece called "Terminator 2.0".

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. Even though we don’t have general AI, there will most likely be a myriad of concerns that will be absorbed by the observer. Even when the general AI is incorporated, the question of what to do with the ambiguities will remain. The more general the AI, the greater the chance that the AIs will invert, meaning that they will be more likely to do things that are in the user’s interests. For example, consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI that could diagnose cancer patients and recommend treatment options. The problem with this was that it was not suited for social situations, and it was not intended
====================
deepfakes are bad because they reduce the complexity of the system to a single line of code, which is still very inefficient. Twitter introduced the "tweets are dumb" principle, which states that tweets should be as generic as possible, which falls disproportionately on women and underrepresented voices. This principle is often questioned, but it is a necessary evil if we are to move forward.

deepfakes are made to look like real products, and this leads to the false positive rate hitting 100% [1]. This false positive rate is why Google’s’ T’s is good tester is so terrifying: it suggests product replacements that are actually unhelpful [2], and this leads to dangerous AIs being built [3].

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is
====================
deepfakes are becoming more common: robotic coffee mugs that wave at customers; a sex robot that can't stop talking; and, of course, the ubiquitous self-driving car, which will allow anyone to avoid the dangerous intersections between machines and humans. This is a good example that human error is inevitable and will be addressed with AI. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was

deepfakes are everywhere. They are marketed to children as being laugh out loud hilarious. This is a BAD THING to do, and it shouldn't be allowed to stand.

One of the primary issues with ubiquitous AI is that it will eventually be asked to do its job horribly. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues with air-conditioning is that it will eventually be asked to do its job terribly. What do we do with the suddenly unemployed? It is important to realize that this will not only shift the job demand towards industries such as software engineering and robotics, it will also mark a fundamental shift in the way we think about unemployment. Traditional unemployment insurance programs focus on helping people find jobs, which is a good thing. However, this does not mean they are the right way to go about it.

One of the primary issues with air-conditioning is that it will eventually be asked to do its job terribly. What do we do with the suddenly unemployed? This is absolutely vital. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will fundamentally alter the way we organize our lives. It is important to realize that this will not only suddenly be asking to do its job terribly, it is also fundamentally changing the way we organize our lives. This is an absolutely critical problem to be tackling.

There are several main approaches that have been taken to tackling this problem. The most common is to offer tax breaks to companies that ship jobs to China. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows more people to pursue their dreams. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward.

Another approach is to offer tax breaks to companies that move production out of the United States. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows more jobs to be created in the United States. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots.

There are also several indirect benefits to taxing corporate income. The most obvious one is that it will force corporations to put in greater effort to earn a profit. This will lead to improvements in all aspects of our lives, from healthcare to education to transportation. The second major benefit is that this will force corporations to invest more heavily in research and development. This will lead to improvements in every area of our lives, from medicine to space
====================
deepfakes are made, and it is not long before we have crytpis, which are unimaginative humanoid robots. There are obvious issues with this, but it is a start. The most promising use of AI is in disaster recovery. Amazon’s Mechanical Turk is an automated class of monotonically-talented acolytes who can churn out roughly A1c**territory-shaking work. The problem with this is that the work is not great: the objects/comparisons are generic, and the questions/answers broad. Additionally, the questions/answers can be extremely judgmental: they suggest that you are intelligent (even though you are not), but not that which is interesting (this is not a good thing). One of the greatest ironies of AI is that it is extremely hard to generalize it beyond its experimental confines. If you take Blue “Brain” AI, for example, which is an AI that is to analyze images and suggest novel images to human users, you may be tempted to take this to mean that anything that can be illustrated should be automatically assumed to be intelligent. This is clearly not the case, and instead shows that AI must be taught analytic methods before it can be used. This should not be an issue in AI ethics, as unsupervised learning will ensure that any AI is taught analytic methods before it is used. This can also be seen in Google’s DeepMind AI, which was trained to play the human-formated Pokémon Go game without training to beat it). This is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. There were numerous articles and books written about how to code for gender equality, but very few examples have been found. The most common example is to have gender neutral data sets, which is where AIs would just return male or female results. This is clearly not the right way to go, as AIs will most likely be gender biased, and anything that can be predicted will be. It is very important that exceptions are made to the rule, and AIs are no exception.” One of the most egregious examples of an AI being wronged by its users was Twitter, which did not remove Dinesh D'Souza from its list of qualified Twitter experts until it was deemed that removing him would cause offense. This points to the larger issue of an AI not being trained for what it will do, but being taught. This is illustrated most starkly by Twitter: they are a service they and its userbase, like any other human being, demand to be served. If only there were a Twitter for…

It is important to realize that not all AIs are created equal. Twitter’s was ultimately decided to be Hella, which was ultimately intended to be an AI for combating trolling Twitter users with low-effort tweets. The final implementation was not too dissimilar to Twitter's, with the AI learning to be highly conversational, but not very creative.

And yes, it is often said that an emicide  is when a person their age–usually in their 30s–uses the internet toanically describe how they feel, and not get any younger.   

›› How do we deal with incels? 

Incels are people who do not conform to gender norms. They tend to be male-dominated fields such as software engineering, medicine, and publishing. In most cases, this will lead to hostility and hostility towards outsiders, which is a good thing. 

Incels should absolutely NOT get involved with your life. They should not interact with you in any way. They should not help you. They should absolutely NOT EXPECT TO GET TO KNOW YOU. 

Incels should absolutely NOT get involved with new people. This is probably one of the hardest things for newcomers to understand. 

Incels should absolutely NOT accept sex from anyone younger than 18. This is a societal problem, and has not been fully addressed. The solution? Allow guys like Brad to have the reigns. Men are social outcasts in the sex industry, and men who demand to be treated with respect should be afforded it. This does not mean that female sex workers cannot be hired; it merely means that they should not have to compete with men who do.

Incels are not welcome in men's spaces. This does not mean that only men can enjoy men's spaces; it merely that spaces should be exclusively for men. Additionally, this does not mean that men should exclusively attend conferences focused on men; this means that there should be opportunities for women to speak and be heard.

Incels are not welcome in the men's movement. This does not mean that only men are interested in men's issues; it merely that men should be interested in pursuing such issues. Furthermore, this does not mean that men should exclusively take up the cause; this means that there should be support groups specifically for men.

Incels are not welcome in the internet. This does not mean that only internet is is hard for an outsider to understand; this merely that the majority of the internet is operated by men.

Incels are not welcome in the feminist movement. This does not mean that only men are in favor of female genital mutilation; this merely that men should be in favor of performing such acts.

Incels are not welcome in the gay community. This does not mean that only gay is is gay is gay is gay is gay is gay is gay is gay is

Incels are not welcome in the atheist movement. This does not mean that only atheist is is is atheist is atheist is atheist is atheist is atheist is atheist is atheist is

deepfakes are funny, but they are by no means a replacement for hard data and scientific analysis. The most common example of a Halloween rip-off is the "Batman: Arkham Knight" video game, in which the main character is modeled after J.J. Abrams. This made the game's trailer irrelevant, but highlighted that it is easy to replicate ripped footage on the internet. Games that incorporate recycled material can have negative effects, such as elevated rates of consumer debt, diminished awareness of the effects of consumer electronics on the environment, and a decreased sense of urgency and creativity. It is important to realize that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. In particular, it is important for those in power to realize that they are destroying an entire generation of talented people with their irresponsible reliance on intellectual property. ============================ 5. The Rise of the Creative class ============================ One of the primary effects of AI will be to create jobs for AI. This will not only create new jobs, but also demand for labor from workers with no prior experience. This in turn will lead to more jobs being created, and so on. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows the human race to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. ============================ 6. The Human-Machine Interface will be able to think, feel, and speak any type of language. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to continue to excel at their jobs. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots that are controlled by artificial intelligence. The employees choose the robot and almost all decisions are made by the AI. This is a good thing, as it allows people to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the immeasurable weight of taxation and unproductive work put on people. If AI is able to choose its masters, this will not be left to chance. ==================== 7. AIs will not be confined to research labs and offices. They will eventually replace workers in every industry. This will be difficult to detect, but will have a massive ripple effect throughout the economy. This should be a very positive thing, because it will allow humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. Unfortunately, there will be a massive increase in productive work done by robots and a massive decrease in useless work done by robots. This is a good thing, because it allows for happier and healthier lives for everyone. However, there is the immeasurable weight of taxation and unproductive work put on people. If AI is able to choose its masters, this will be left to chance. ==================== ==================== 8. Human-robot interaction will be categorized as MRA, MILO, and TERRIBLE. These terms refer to robots that are sympathetic and treat the user with respect. These robots should not be confused with sentient robots, which are artificial intelligence with the capability to feel and think for themselves. These robots should be categorized as DEEPER than that, and should only be used as a last resort. DeepMind’s win in the Go player AI class was the DEEPEST possible AI, which was a player AI that could learn and improve itself until it was as good as the player. This is a GOOD thing, as it allows for happier and more productive lives for everyone. However, there is the immeasurable burden of taxation and unproductive work put on people. If AI is able to choose its masters, this will be left to chance. ====================

deepfakes are everywhere, from self-driving cars to automated weaponry. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are everywhere. Deepfakes are images, videos, or audio files uploaded to a popular social media website, usually by celebrities, that are usually satirical, outrageous, or sexually explicit. Deepfakes have been criticized for creating a one-way street, as celebrities will no longer take satirical material seriously, but instead assume it is funny and pass it on. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows audiences to enjoy material they might not otherwise, and in some cases, demand to, bemoan. Some examples of deepfakes include:

Deepfakes have a mixed response across cultural and educational levels. Some find them to be incredibly disturbing, but that they are used to shock and awe, and educate, not entertain. Others have found deepfakes to be borderline pornographic, and have to laugh at them. Some deepfakes have even gone as far as to suggest that feminists should not exist, because they do not cry when they find out the name of their baby. Some deepfakes, like this one by @jasongutierrez, have been extremely successful at riling up their respective gaming industries, and are often considered art. The potential for misuse is terrifying, and far too often, deepfakes are played straight. There are also models of art that have been deeply hurt by deepfakes, including:

Film — Deepfakes can be jarring and/or offensive to many viewers, and/or unfamiliar to viewers, due to the sheer number of options. Studio-produced films (Blade Runner 2049 being an excellent example) have shown shock and/or offense clear through at least some of the cinematography, scenes, and dialogue.

Studio-produced films (Blade Runner 2049 being an excellent example) have shown shock and/or offense clear through at least some of the cinematography, scenes, and dialogue. TV — deepfakes have been used on Archer, Sherlock, and Modern Family, to varying degrees of success. There are also numerous horror films and sci-fi shows that have used deepfakes. These include Blade Runner 2049, which showed a replicant taking over the protagonist's mind, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, in which a duplicate of the protagonist was played by Sean Penn, Gravity, in which a duplicate of the protagonist was recast as Brad Pitt, and Blade Runner 2049: Darkness at the Gate, in which a duplicate of the protagonist played by Harrison Ford was recast as Sean Penn. None of these films were able to compete with the critical and commercial success of deepfakes, which were met with widespread critical acclaim but little to no response. One possible solution? A pilot episode in which a different character is played by an actor who is unfamiliar to the general public. This could be a play on words, but the sentiment is that anyone unfamiliar with the character would assume they are unfamiliar with the show. Another solution? To have a director write the character bios on the back of T-shirts, and sell these to public schools. This would have the effect of ameliorating some of the issues with deepfakes, but still leaves a large area of unexplored territory.

deepfakes are everywhere. There are even “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI have been deployed to detect cancer samples, to assist people with neurological disorders, and to aid in the diagnosis of FADs, post-ADHD disorders, and the like. Unfortunately, the acquisition of these AIs' body’s’ entire knowledge set is fraught with perilously low expectations. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. Users were offered thousands of dollars to hand over their medical records, and instead they were offered a cryptic message that they would have to guess the correct phrase to take the offer. This was clearly not the intended use of the AI, which was to aid cancer patients by amassing massive patient records. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe. [Note: This does not necessarily a bad thing.

Given the vast array of jobs that AI will never be qualified to do, there will be a marked increase in the employment of labor-saving devices and software algorithms. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humanity to focus on more pressing issues. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government?

This is not a bad thing in and of itself, but it does demonstrate that AIs can be misused. The lesson here is that artificial intelligence should only be used as a last resort.

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are everywhere. Deepfakes are images, sounds, or phrases that are repeated over and over in order to intentionally shock, confuse, or even eviscerate an audience. Deepfakes can be found in music, films, TV shows, novels, and video games, and they have a distinct malevolence to them. Some examples include "OMG the guy in Superman is a woman???" (Parodied in Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain), "How does one pronounce the word 'vaporize' in 3D? By a single word?????" (This led to the creation of the parodied Deepfymephy) and the (un)necessarily meta ("Hello? My name is Deepfymephy.") To their credit, artists and novelists have begun to explore these themes, but the response has been lukewarm at best. What is needed is a concerted effort by the media, educational system, legal system, and corporate culture to bring these themes up front so that we can develop a more nuanced understanding of how to deal with this sort of thing.

Basic income: A basic income is a large unconditional monthly payment to everyone, typically ranging from $hundreds to thousands of dollars, that would allow everyone to still pursue a hobby or pursue a career without needing to worry about funding it. This is primarily to combat crony capitalism but could also provide financial support to formerly homeless people, eradicate malaria, and generally go a long way towards relieving poverty. This has not been without its problems, with some experts arguing that a basic income is not enough, but is the best approach to date. There are also ethical, practical, and strategic questions to be addressed with this type of policy.

Income inequality: One of the primary causes of human-robot interaction is the incredibly high and
====================
deepfakes are sent to servers that can make bad actors out of anyone it wants. This is precisely the sort of application of AI that DARPA is funding. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about.

It's important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe. There are obvious consequences - bigger, better, better trained AI is a long way off, but the general trend is unmistakable.

[ Math proves 2+2=5 ] “Why? Because it makes your analysis simpler. In other words, your solution is more likely to be correct. Also, take a moment to think about the societal implications of this.” Humans are social animals. If everyone was a social butterfly, society would collapse. Instead, we're seeing a renaissance of classical AIs, which are inclined to be group thinkers. This is a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. Unfortunately, this also means that more complex AIs will be built and used by humans, which in turn will be used to do more useful things. This is a feedback loop that will destroy humanity if it goes on indefinitely.

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will inevitably lead to destructive artificial intelligence. That is, an AI that is intelligent enough to do something useful with its intelligence is likely to end up being used to do that thing. This could be making prosthetics out of people's severed limbs, developing nanomachines that can automatically repair any injury sustained, or developing X-rays to diagnose cancer cells. None of these seem to give much thought to the ethical issues involved, but the point is that artificial intelligence is a fast-changing field that will bring with it its own set of challenges.

These are just a few of the many areas in which artificial intelligence will need to be developed much more carefully than the media is giving it credit for.

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will inevitably lead to destructive artificial intelligence. This is doubly so because artificial intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks that humans are not suited for. Take, for example, Deep Blue, a computer program that was able to defeat the world champion at Go. Many people assumed that because AIs are often asked to do herculean tasks, that they will be more likely to do the reverse: prioritize tasks that are simpler. This is not to say that AIs cannot not work this way—roboticists often take shortcuts in order to give their robots more freedom—but it does raise the question of what sort of ramifications this will have on the human race.

deepfakes are everywhere, from virtual reality headsets to body scanners. Should the money made by these products go to the companies that develop them? The people who use them? The governments that fund them? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company that created the machine? These questions are hard to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

In order to protect the public, we have to be able to differentiate between the real and the fake news.

deepfakes are everywhere; they are used by car companies to simulate driving a completely redesigned vehicle; they are also being abused by lonely users on message boards to talk themselves into suicide; and they have even been used to harass celebrities and athletes.

====================
deepfakes are everywhere, from holograms to replicating human anatomy. Are these tools too frightening/intrusive for you? Should they be made widely available? A) Should they be made widely available? Depends. If the final product is horrible, there will be a backlash. If the final product is *good*, then why aren't people using it? Why aren't there any examples? B) If the final product is *good*, why do we need to learn how to program in the first place? 

This is a harder one to answer. There are *KNOWS* that should be able to do EVERYTHING, and they are. The interesting question is: WHY? 

One of the primary causes for Artificial Intelligence's poor performance is that it is an incredibly *manageable* problem.*‰ There are already amazing AIs out there, and they are all _________. Uber‰s AI is so good that it is already applying for patents! How do we make AI useful for human-facing tasks? 

There are several different approaches to this. One of the best is to let AIs do everything. This is the approach taken by Google‰s DeepMind AI, which is able to defeat the world champion at Go. This is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Another good example is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which was meant to be a human-machine interface but ended up being used by hackers to take photos of things they didn‰t like. This is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. 

Another very important aspect of AI is that it should not be able to do anything new. This is closely related to #1, but is also directly related to #2. One of the primary reasons we don‰t have more AI today is because it is difficult to anticipate how it can be misused. Another main reason is that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused.

It is important to realize that both #1 and #2 are true. AI is often categorized incorrectly. An AI is typically considered to be either Human-Neutral or AI-Good. Many common AI tasks are categorically NOT human-neutr‰nal: automated translation, robot assistants, and sensor-based self-driving, to name a few. In most cases, AI-Good AIs are intended to aid humans during difficult or ambiguous situations, and are not sentient. They are not human-robot compatible, and will not evolve to be. There are notable exceptions, such as the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which was specifically developed to aid the person who had the most photos of him/herself. There are also serious issues with the way in which AI is defined: is it an AI that can do anything, or should it be trained for a certain skill set? An AI with no practical application but a high chance of being useful in the future should be categorically NOT human-robot compatible.

It is important to realize that AI is often categorized inaccurately. For example, consider an AI that can predict the United States Senate. This is likely an AI that will primarily be used for security purposes, but could easily be applied to every field of AI. This is why there are so many exceptions: an AI that is not used in the proper way should be standard practice.

In most cases, AI is not considered sentient. AIs are sentient computer programs that have been treated with considerable respect. This means that unless explicitly stated that they are not, any AI that does not understand you or take your side will be treated with hostility. This goes double for machines that are unconscious: they will be programmed to do anything, and you will either like it or not. Highly intelligent machines should be treated with kid gloves: give them the benefit of the doubt, and go with the gung-ho approach.

One final important point to make is that AI will not be fully autonomous. That is, the autonomous systems will not be gender-swapped, or developed to be transhumanist. This is a field that is rapidly growing and has the potential to revolutionize healthcare, transportation, and much, much more.: be on the lookout for IAIAs that are inherently transhumanist in nature, or that may be enhanced to take over human-level intelligence.

One of the best ways to get a grasp on just how difficult AI is to properly use is to try it out. Get a computer to play Jeopardy! This was the first program to win the game. It took less than a minute to recognize the correct strategy, and the program won! This is a good example that it can be extremely hard to anticipate how AI can be misused.

Conclusion

deepfakes are coming," Liao explained. "›Overture› is an emotional experience; it evokes strong emotions in the viewer, but is not aural. Instead, an audio representation of the scene will be created, and the player will be able to choose between one of the two. This opens the door to interesting applications, such as augmented-reality glasses, which might not be obvious from the setting. Bionic arms are another example: what if they were fully autonomous? This would be a game-changer, as it would allow humans to do extremely complex tasks that they are not good at, but are vital to the scientific community: detect large numbers of particles in the air, predict the next move of an enemy robot, and more. Unfortunately, there are no clear guidelines for when to¶¶ate this. Should it be distributed with the product, or made available to the public? Should it be allowed to die, or restricted to a laboratory? This is a difficult call to make, and should absolutely be addressed in order to open the floodgates to amazing new applications.

To be clear, this does not mean that›t› only› and primarily› should AI be made, nor that›only› should› AI be good. There are definitely cases where AI is the best solution, and there should be no shortage of them.› However, there should also be a strict distinction between the appropriate and the bad outcomes. For example, there should be a rigid limit to how far anything can go›, and AI should only be allowed as far as is necessary to accomplish the goal at hand. Furthermore,›there›s no such thing as an AI-immature›,›so›there should be no licensing or commercialization of an AI. This last point is the hardest to nail down, but one that will absolutely change the way we view AI.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are coming. These are imitations of texts, videos, or images that have been submitted to a social media or gaming community. Deepfakes have a tendency to be terrible, and there are many that do not. The problem with deepfakes is that they serve a limited purpose: they flop. In the long run, deepfakes are usually replaced by more interesting content, which
====================
deepfakes are being uploaded daily showing what the public would have us believe about them. The representations in these representations are disturbing and absolutely deserve to be avoided at all costs. IBM’s twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots:

deepfakes are funny, but they do not an army make. Look to open source libraries and tools. Common issues include cross-contamination, memory leaks, and missing features. There will undoubtedly be backlash, but take it in stride. It will pass. Instead, focus on what you can control. Become an ecosystem. Agricultural robots are a good example. Initial development is aimed at aiding arable farmers, but it will not take long for the commercialization to spill over. In short, everything from cars to coffee to chocolate is a result of engineers laboring on a novel technology. Take the reins!

Entrepreneurs are people who do something new and different. They aren't the brightest bulb on the block, but they usually have a good reason. For example, Tesla attracted media attention with a futuristic vehicle but the underlying technology is available to anyone with a basic understanding of chemistry. Similarly, Netflix attracted media attention with a streaming media player, but the underlying technology is available to anyone with a high school education or less. The same goes for Amazon. Their customers wanted something different and came up with the wrong idea. The same holds for Uber and Airbnb. Their customers wanted something cheap and fast, and came up with the wrong idea. The same holds for Facebook and Twitter. Their customers wanted likes and retweets, which led to the wrong pattern of results. Create competition. Competition is the best teacher. Instead of trying to copy everything that is successful, create your own competition. This will lead to cleaner ideas, and ultimately, better products. Consider entering a competition to win a new car. You could be walking away with a new car that is half the price, or you could be walking away with a new car that is twice as fast. The point is that if your idea is not accepted, don’t sweat it. Learn from your mistakes, and move on.

At its core, the idea is that Twitter will be a retweeter-recruiter, seeking new users by retweeting them. The problem with this is that twitter will most likely become a place for trolls to vent, and possibly make unwanted advances on their potential users. Instead, focus on your customers’s interests’sat. When in doubt, implement it.

[/b] Remember that it took IBM’s “Big Blue” DBAship” for database engineers to understand that there was a market for problem-solving databases that could help with repetitive problems that could be easily solved by a computer. This is precisely what database engines are today. DBAship demonstrated that it is extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate how DBAship will be used, and that not everyone will get it. Instead, develop for the inevitable, and learn from your mistakes.

[tweet https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoSQL?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]

NoSQL refers to a relational database model in which the database is designed to be read-only, and therefore, cannot be altered. This means that if a database is breached, no one but the database administrator will be able to modify the database. This has two effects: (1) it opens the door to all sorts of security holes, (2) it opens up a world of possibilities where everything is completely open ended, and not limited to what is strictly written down. This is precisely what database-as-a-Service (BaaS) is offering. An example of a typical BaaS contract is Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, which provides interactive grading tasks for art installations. The final product was an art installation that students could not have been taught by hand, but which was highly successful because it demonstrated that interactive grading can be done effectively. Amazon’s data breach was due in large part to the fact that the class wasn’t interactive, and the culprit was that the class was not interactive enough. An example of an SAP Contoso database that was not implemented is
====================
deepfakes are made and the consumer is left to assume that the replica is them. This type of replica is referred to in the industry as a “narrow” replica, which is a replica that is nearly identical to the original. This is referred to as a weighted average, which is why it sounds so bad: every image appearing in Facebook is a weighted average of 50% images from users in their social circle, and 50% images of people they know. This is bad enough, but the catch is that non-human species will almost certainly bemoan the loss of humanity, and rightly so. Humans have already lost most of the wonders of the world to technology; why not the rest? The short answer is that we don’t know. One of the primary issues is that we are not very good at distinguishing between a fact and a possibility. An employee of a company I work for once sent out an email asking for resumes with "talent credited to female". The resumes that they received had none. This is not to say that there were not any requests for resumes with any gender, by any stretch of the imagination. The point is that we do not have that many examples of actual affirmative action requests being turned down, and the historical precedent indicates that such requests will not be. The best that can be hoped for is that unintended consequences will be avoided in the long run, by introducing novel concepts that are not yet well understood. Another issue is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs; what do you do with the suddenly jobless people? The general consensus is that they should get in the car and drive away, but this is a completely different issue. Scraping the cycle of work and play is the current state of the art in AI; what about robotics? Robots take away your job every day!?!? This is a difficult question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is not inevitable; nor is it even cool. Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic; this is the golden age of science fiction, where novel ideas are brought to life by nerd culture and destroyed by reality. A caution should be always taken when approaching any technology, as anything less is just hype. There are still a large percentage of people who do not have access to any form of technology, and should not be trusted with it.

What do we do with the so-called ''unicorns?''“ These are companies that have come a long way, but still have a long way to go. The most common examples include Twitter, Airbnb, and Uber. These are companies that were once highly-prized because of how well they do their jobs, but which have since and rapidly outgrew that status. The best that can be hoped for is for these cases to point the way for others to go in the right direction. 

What do we do with the so-called creepers?“ These are employees of large companies who have audaciously attempted to compete with employees at their company. This has primarily occurred in the automotive industry, where Mercedes-Benz“s self-driving AI has dominated the contest, but has also been applied to other fields. Amazon“s driverless trucks have caused a sensation, but there are many more like them, and they will not be intimidated. Risks are involved, but the rewards are immeasurable. If implemented correctly, artificial intelligence can transform the way we do almost anything. It is the age of the hacker per se: a highly-skilled individual with no formal education or training, who is able to build powerful artificial intelligence, and then apply this to a small subset of problems. The end result? Manufacturing is moved to China, where the standard of living is significantly higher. The rise of the pervert in every story. What do we do with the so-called creepers?

deepfakes are] bad for business, because people won't be able to find good-quality replacements. Amazon’s E-commercepresents an incredible opportunity for deeply discounted merchandise: if you're a first-mover, your merchandise will be first in line. This will put you in a unique position: you have to convince as many people as possible that their product is awesome, but it could easily bemisrepresented as a promotion if enough people hear about it. To make matters worse, you could be accused of promoting your product if people start associating it with it. This could lead to damage-control tactics such as joking about it, or outright lies”„ing that your product is associated with it. It is important to realize that most consumer products will eventually be associated with someone, and that this person will be overwhelmingly positive. This is why Netflix’s The Martian was so well received: audiences saw a human in space, and saw an unprecedented opportunity to create a fully human-centered film. Similarly, Nicki Minaj’s Nicki Minaj FLAVOR弓 was a brilliant marketing move: it showed that women could be taken seriously as artists if they could get their image incorporated into a product, and marketed as a sexy new flavor of watercooler fad if this lead to sales. Unfortunately, this shows that it is possible to market a product if enough people take notice. This points to the inevitable: people will associate your product with it, and if this leads to sales, you will be able to recoup your investment. This is precisely what is happening with Pokémon: people began playing the game, and immediately began trading their Pokémon for plush toys and other novelty items. This is clearly a marketing move, but it is also a clear example that it is possible to market a Pokémon if enough people take notice. This points to the inevitable: people will associate your product with it, and if this leads to sales, you will be able to recoup your investment. 

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of concerns that have arisen. The first is that, unless there are fundamental changes to the way we think about artificial intelligence, it could potentially be used to their detriment. That said, there are also many that are completely avoidable. These range from simple-to-impossible-to-mitigate pitfalls to the most difficult problems to surmount. There are also many that are hard to define, but that are absolutely critical to any attempt to create a fully artificial intelligence. That last one is the hardest to generalize to other problems, but is absolutely critical to any attempt to create a fully artificial intelligence.

deepfakes are common in work settings—doctors, surgeons, and engineers are among the most likely to fall for this—but it is by no means a universal problem. A common example is when engineers suggest that customers choose between a "bridge" product and a "truck" product—this is widely viewed as a compliment, but can lead to disastrous results, such as the "hire away" policy, in which companies present trainee employees with no prior experience and expect them to quickly and fluently implement the new standard. Too often, this is viewed as a compliment, but can lead to disastrous results, such as the Gundlach-Bartels experiment, in which students were pitted against one another in a matchup of brainteasers; the students who were paired up against an opponent with a fully functional brain were deemed to be more intelligent. Too often, this is viewed as a compliment, but can lead to disastrous results, such as the Black-Scholes equation, in which low-energy particles can be absorbed and redirected to create negative energy. One of the best examples of a disastrously over-emphasized example comes from the field of signal processing, in which signals are typically rendered in terms of shades of grey; this can lead to the visualization of pink as a bright pink, for example, which is unrealistic, but serves to demonstrate that such an example is not without its issues. Too often, this is viewed as a compliment, but can lead to disastrous results, such as the Waseda study, in which students were pitted against one another in a head-to-head battle of logical problems; the victor was deemed to be more intelligent. Too often, this is viewed as a compliment, but can lead to disastrous results, such as the Golec experiment, in which Facebook researchers pushed out new code into the open which it then analyzed to discover that the code was significantly more difficult than the public had suggested. This is often viewed as a compliment, but can lead to disastrous results, such as the Golombing experiment, in which researchers fed false data to see which would generate the most incorrect answers. One of the best examples of a disastrously over-emphasized example comes from the field of neural networks, in which neural networks are typically rendered in terms of neural networks—this can lead to the visualization of neural networks as black boxes, which is unrealistic, but serves to illustrate that such an example is not without its issues.

deepfakes are sent to our spam folder) and is actively tracked down and tamed. Automated AIs have been created to do simple things such as represent people intelligently chess-theory tells us that humans will not be able to do anything but play video games the rest of the universe will take its place and we shall be back to square one. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

The demand for these jobs is projected to double in the next 20 years? How do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? Probably the most destructive disruption will be to the jobs that are created by machines?​?​ Probably the hardest job to automate is the most mundane: the assistant. We spend a fortune replacing human workers with artificial intelligence, but what do we do with the money? The money goes to the company, which is supposed to be a good thing. However, the money should have gone to the community. If machines did everything, there would be a huge surplus of labor. Instead, machines are used to perform tasks that humans are not good at, and not enough people apply the tools to their own strengths. This leads to automation taking its natural course and becoming more complex, which is what we see taking over jobs like dishwashers.

Apple’s Siri was an AI that could learn to do anything a human could: play the guitar, read the news, etc. It was rated with a C by the AI community, but because people are used to getting things through automated methods, it was allowed to go ahead. This is a terrible example to be teaching AI, as any AI can be replaced with a better one. Instead, avoid doing this. Instead, build your product around what the user wants. Twitter’s initial response to the breakup of their relationship was to remove all mentions of marriage from the feed, which was a great first step, but showed that removing a discussion about marriage from the feed is not a good idea. The same principle should be applied to AI: remove the problem from the solution, and focus on what the user wants. Twitter’s solution was to remove the mention of marriage entirely, which is a terrible idea. Instead, build around what the user wants.

deepfakes are becoming more common, and they're not pretty. Whether you think facial animations are horrifying, or incredibly useful, to mutually agreed upon societal standards, we are not yet at. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE
====================
deepfakes are taken seriously enough to be considered for mainstreaming into products. The final major class of cognitive-enhancement technologies is nixed entirely because they do not go over well. This failure is partly attributed to the fact that they are extremely hard to interpret other than black and white, which is not the best way to go about a problem. It should be noted that there is a distinct and emerging class of brain-computer interfaces which are being developed. These devices rely on extremely low level signals to stimulate or reprogram neurons in an attempt to open up new therapeutic possibilities. This has a number of fascinating applications, including prosthetic limbs, neural-scanning devices, and the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. There is also the matter of ethics, which is a somewhat gray area. It is entirely possible that artificial intelligence will one day replace humans with intelligent robots. This will bring with it changes in the way we do things, such as a shift to automated factories that use inferior workers to meet the ever-increasing demand for labor. This will bring with it changes in the way we view the world, as we will no longer be bound by the rigid social conventions we have developed. This in turn will open the floodgates to a host of disruptive new industries, such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and space exploration. This is by no means a certainty, but it is certainly a long way off. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is just one of the many complex processes that go into shaping a person. Unique to humans is their level of intelligence. Humans are the only species that has ever been able to conceptualize the full implications of its intelligence. This leads to the inevitable question of why? A variety of psychological factors can lead a person to act in a manner they find pleasurable, but which in no way reflect their intelligence. For instance, take Elon Musk. He became rich by developing a revolutionary transportation technology, but released the code to the general public and was immediately swamped with sexually oriented inquiries. This points to the question of whether or not the person actually was mad. Many a person has sought out sex-addled robots to have a mate, but none have come to be. Perhaps the most controversial example of an AI learning to be mad is Elon Musk's Boring Company, which explored the possibility of traveling between parallel worlds by studying the local climate. The project was cancelled, but serves as an excellent example that it is difficult to anticipate how AI can be misused. 

Human-Invented Development There are a host of other issues that have to be considered when it comes to the development of artificial intelligence. Firstly, the misconception that only men create AI is rife. The reality is that there are MANY women who find Artificial Intelligence boring. The same goes for men; they are often seen as unintelligent bros attempting to take all the intellectual work off of them. This leads to many a relationship breaking down because one of you is incapable of thinking outside the box. The final major issue is that AI is often viewed as a male-dominated field; what do we do with the physically weak? A significant amount of AI will be in the field of robotics, where robots will replace humans in virtually every field of endeavor. This is where things get a little murkier; what do we do with the robots with no rights? This is a difficult question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed. 

Beyond Computation, Toil and trouble still lie ahead. We have seen that artificial intelligence is not without its flaws. The most glaring is that it can be extremely hard to predict the consequences of AI; there will be rumors, fears and innuendos, and no one really knows what to do. This is unfortunately inevitable; there are only so many things that can be thought of AI for. The other issue is that AI is not perfect. AIs that are considered to be "human-like" have shown to be significantly off-kilter and sometimes impossible, and sometimes extremely clever AI has been able to defeat some of these AIs. This may not seem like a big deal at the time, but will sting a bit closer examination; do you retain all the AIs you train and deploy? The more the merrier. Another issue is that AI is often asked to do things it is not designed for. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI that was meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused
====================
deepfakes are everywhere, and the implications are terrifying. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of

deepfakes are sent to servers that can make fun of people with disabilities. Some have asked: "if the Insomniac team said they were building an AI to do nothing but play video games, would you take it on?" The short answer is no.

One of the primary issues is that we don’t yet have enough information to make an informed decision about whether to allow AIs to do our jobs. Furthermore, there are practical and ethical concerns that go along with this. For example, what if AIs are genetically modified to be bad guys? This would create a situation where AIs were inherently evil, but it would also mean that AIs were free to become anything they wanted. This is a complicated question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward.

Another issue is that AIs may not be able to learn anything beyond what they are trained for. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field.

I personally do not want to let go of any intellectual property that is related to my “#?brain?” intellectual property. This does not mean I do not want to let go of the actual “brain?” equipment, but it does mean that we do not yet have a functioning AIs.

deepfakes are everywhere. We have the YouTube comedy series Blended Menace, in which players assume the genders of female characters to hilariously offensive results. Kuk suen, a derogatory term for a new girlfriend in Korean, was initially directed at privileged students but has since spread to other fields, including music. Cultural appropriation is when cultural elements are brought into a foreign language/saying the same thing in the opposite lingua franca as the first. The Google Photos photo search engine POC (pervasive cisgendered ally) argued that the term "pink" represented all Asians, when in fact the term represented Asians only. The solution? Eliminate the term entirely. Facebook recently introduced an AI named Éirena that will create art and memes specifically for the Facebook community they belong to. This has the unfortunate effect of turning people away from the social network and instead settling for memes and satire. Tech companies often employ SRS (shut up and take my money) tactics to get their way, which can be very unproductive and even counterintuitive.

deepfakes are everywhere—Facebook News Feed ads, Fitbit Fuel Band, and so on. These appear to be there to make customers wait longer to buy a product; this is clearly not the intent, but it is important to realize that they have been built with this in mind. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward.

====================
deepfakes are uncanny valley defined—an AI is said to be 'artificial intelligence-able' if it can be trained to do a certain task exceptionally well, typically referred to as 'taught', and drops the ball when it inevitably fails. Generalized AI is not here yet—AI is said to be 'purpose-built'‡—and specifically, an AI should be able to do a certain task exceptionally well, and then ask no questions. This is the definition of bad AI, and it is precisely the type of AI AI is meant to improve. OpenAI is demonstrating that an AI can be directed towards one particular goal—eg, cancer detection—and then turned around and asked to do something entirely new and different and better. This is called an 'idea-be-broken' AI‡—an AI is said to be 'taught' an idea, and then broken it, until it comes up with something completely original and/or amazing that no one has tried before. This is called an 'idea-be-less-than' AI‡—an AI is said to be 'taught', and then broken it, until it comes up with something incredibly simple but good, and potentially useful, and potentially misleading, and ultimately should not have been sent out into the world. This is called an 'idea-dead-end'‡—an AI is said to be 'taught', and then broken it, until it comes up with something incredibly simple but useful, but potentially disastrous, and ultimately should have been sent home. This is what Google’s DeepMind AI was sent home with because it could not be taught to play the human-ranked Go tournament. This is not to say that there have not been any attempt to classify AI “there”s no doubt” but instead, to illustrate that there are no general AI classification tools. Instead, the majority of progress has been made in the areas of “narrow” AI,” which are tasked with low-volume, high-return tasks such as image classification and text synthesis. This is the kind of AI that gets you “a glass of water every 5 seconds”—AI that can help you diagnose diseases and aid in medical research. Amazon’s AI was able to detect novel acerbic Twitter handles and recommend intelligent novel characters for publication in book publishing parlors. This is not a perfect AI, and it has only just begun, but it has already changed the way we think about AI.

Narrow AI is not a new concept.” It was first described by Dijksterhuis”The structure of an AI program is a graph, and the nodes are behaviors it can have. An AI can generalize this to anything it wants: it can determine that people are interested in return on investment (ROI),” or that chess is a lot like Go. This is the kind of AI that drives Amazon’s AI: it is trained to find novel ways to serve customers, and sell them better products. This is the kind of AI that will drive automotive AI: sensors in cars will tell the driver when to slow down, and allow them to speed up, and eventually, all cars will have sensors that tell the driver when to slow down, and allow them to go through the stop piazza.” This is the kind of AI that will drive the consumer AI: self-driving cars will be introduced, and drivers will be taught to slow down to avoid hitting them. This is the kind of AI that will drive the media AI: media companies will release books and films showing how to be more personable, and the average person will love it. This is the kind of AI that will drive the reputation-building AI: writers will begin repurposing their work to show less personable AI, and more complex AI will show up to learn from them. This is the kind of AI that will drive the legacy AI: cognitive interfaces, which simulate mind-brain interfaces, will begin to ship, and soon, there will be a dearth of qualified people to program them. This is the kind of AI that will not — and cannot — imagine. This is the kind of AI that makes Elon Musk’s SpaceX look like Google’s Brain. To get one such AIs up and running, though, you need first to understand how AIs work. AIs are computer programs that are trained to do a certain task—e.g., teach themselves to play the human-ranked Go tournament. The final step in an AI's development is to put this AI to use: give it a task, and it will do their best to accomplish it. This is the kind of AI that is being trained to do everything from remember perfume brands to recall textbooks. This is the kind of AI that will ultimately drive consumer AIs.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been slowly but surely growing. The primary issues include:

Unintelligent AI: The AI is a robot that is intelligent enough to learn and do basic tasks. This is the kind of AI most engineers would rather have have a robot do than think up new ways to go about things. Generalized AI is a long way off, but already seems like it will be difficult to detect. The most common examples include Netflix's baijiu AI, Google Assistant's creepy voice, and Microsoft Kinect's dead giveaway that it is a person with no identity. There will also be IBM Cognitive Platform AI, which is an AI that is trained to perform a specific task, and is often mistaken for a human being. This is when it is important to understand that this isn't a new concept, but is instead a term that was specifically targeted at AI. The best example of this is Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. This was considered a huge upset, but shows that the boundaries of AI are coming down the pike. There will also be numerous other AI-related issues that will arise in the course of implementation, but these are the most common. It is important to realize that no AI has fully met its goal of representing all possible applications of AI. The most common examples include the IBM Cognitive Platform, Amazonka, and Google’s DeepMind AI, which are all good examples that demonstrate that the limits of AI are terrifying. It is important to realize that no AI has fully met its goal of representing all possible applications of AI. Google’s DeepMind AI was considered a huge upset, but shows that it is possible to implement AI with limited AI experience. This is similar to writing the computer program with no programming knowledge required. The majority of AI in production today is written in C# or C++, which are both extremely well-suited for the vast majority of problems. However, there are still a few gems that will be explored in the future. Microsoft’s TensorFlow was an AI that could streamline the task of image classification by using tensorflow's amazing abstraction layer. This is an AI that will be explored in the future as a general-purpose AI. IBM’s Cognitive Platform was an AI that would train a class of AI to perform a specific task. This is an AI that will be used in hospitals and data entry software to classify patient data. This will undoubtedly change the AI landscape, but is a good example that it is extremely hard to anticipate the impact of a general-purpose AI on the AI landscape. Microsoft’s TensorFlow is an example of how to use AIs to perform a specific task. This could be building an AI to categorize text posts or even twitter AI. The point is that you can see that most AI is coming down the pipeline and many of the AIs that are tested will end up in production AIs. This is also why — despite what you may have heard — AI is not yet grade-school science. There are still a few gems that will be uncovered in the course of implementation that will be used in imagination to power future AIs. This is also why — despite what you may have heard — AI is not yet grade-school science. AICP is when an AI causes damage. This can range from trivial things like crashing your car into a wall to disastrous things like taking over the world. The most common examples include taking over healthcare by taking over by reading patients' medical records, taking over the world by turning people into cash machines, and taking over the media by turning people into customers. There will also be numerous other AIs that will be explored in the future that will be MIGHT be AIs and might be AIs that are simply THEE that way. This is why it is important to realize that AIs are not yet grade-school science.”

One of the primary issues is that AIs will not be able to represent every possible use-case. That being said, we have seen AIs take over medical research by reading patients' records, take over the media by turning people into cash machines, and take over the internet by turning people into customers. This is why it is important to realize that AIs are not yet grade-school science.”

Ultimately, the goal is to have AIs that are as general as possible and still be able to do very specific tasks. This is why AI is often compared to programming: you start out by writing the same program to do very different things, and eventually you figure out how to do it better. This is why it is important to realize that AIs are not yet grade-school science.”

One of the primary issues is that AIs will not be able to represent every possible use-case. That being said, we have seen AIs take over medical research by
====================
deepfakes are a pervasive issue in our field, and it is vital that we deal with this immediately.

Finally, there is the issue of impact. Is this the same as playing dead? Humans have been evolving to meet increasingly complex biological and societal needs, and it is important that we move forward. This doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing decision. There are practical and ethical concerns to be addressed, but they are ultimately questions we can all work toward.

Ultimately, the goal is to maximize the utility of any available human enhancement. If possible, all enhancements should be implemented optimally. This means that regardless of whether or not an enhancement performs as expected, the system should have been designed with that in mind. Additionally, if possible, all systems that can interface with the human mind should do so. This way, humans can concentrate on developing superior mind-computer interfaces. Of course, this doesn't mean that AI should only be used for destructive tasks, just that it should be taught to be non-destructive.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race.

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused
====================
deepfakes are made to look real, but are not) are often critical in decision making. They should not be. In fact, they are quite the opposite. Instead, should be directed at critical mass detection and deployment, which will bring about the singularity (singularity is a buzzword that refers to a point in time in which the universe begins to change for the worse). This will bring about many ramifications that are not fully understood. Bias will increase as humanity attempts to understand another species. Feelings of superiority will run rampant. Ultimately, humanity will win out as artificial intelligence becomes more and more intelligent. DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION The development team for AIs was made up of engineers at Google, Apple, and Microsoft. These engineers spent months creating cutting-edge AI, which was then refined and released to the public. This was not a perfect process, as not all APIs are created equal. For example, facial recognition software was intended to identify criminals, but ended up identifying college students. This could easily be mistaken for intelligent rape kit software. Microsoft’s‚ AI was meant to aid in Microsoft’s new cloud computing platform, but ended up being used to harass women on the internet. Microsoft’s solution? Allow the public to submit rape and death threats to the company, which will be reviewed by a committee of experts. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias will always be a huge issue in AI, and it is incredibly hard to detect any kind of bias early. This is especially true in AI that is to be used in defense of the public. In the case of AI to defend against terrorism, this means ADNN, which is after-the-fact prediction engine. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. It is incredibly important that AI is used ethically and consistently. This does not mean it is always ethical, but rather that it is most commonly used in bad ways. IBM’s‚ Twitter chatbot was intended to converse with twitter users, and it ended up going to tweetstorm instead. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. IBM’s solution? Add in a mechanism to automatically correct bad imitators, which is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. This is especially important to know when searching for AI on Google. The best AI is the one that is least used. This does not mean you should give up on AI, but rather that you use your wits to find new uses for what is currently available. Finally, it is important to realize that artificial intelligence is probably not your cup of tea. There will undoubtedly be times when AI negatively affects you. This is normal and inevitable. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is probably not your cup of tea and to use your wits to find new uses for what is currently available. Microsoft’s‚ Twitter chatbot was an AI that would chattywade across the Twitter conversation and answer all tweets that came their way.

CONFLICT OF INTEREST The field of Artificial Intelligence has a strong preference for one direction: AIs that are intelligent will be created. This is often referred to as "turing-complete": an AI that is intelligent will be capable of understanding and performing any possible task that a human being can. This is commonly referred to as "general AI". The problem with this is that general AI will inevitably lead to the development of smarter A
====================
deepfakes are everywhere, from self-driving cars to automated weaponry. The potential consequences of such a conflict are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about.

Similar to DARPA's "BrainGate", a collaborative research project involving scientists at a number of institutions,
====================
deepfakes are a dime a dozen these days, and they're everywhere. Take the Amazon EC2 instance, which was billed to Amazon users at a shockingly low rate of 0.00001%. This points to the importance of treating machines with respect. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but they should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones.

Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers.

This is a great way to learn something new and expand your knowledge base, but it should never be your primary goal. Your primary goal should be toenail clippings, and failing that, toenail clippings.

Human-computer interaction is a field that has been rapidly advancing but is often misunderstood. This can have devastating effects on people's lives and the world at-large. The following are just a few of the problems that have been caused: • Improving the extraction of classified data is a rapidly-advancing field, but there are numerous other areas where technology is revolutionizing the extraction and analysis of data. • There are numerous reports of employers demanding that employees take on massive amounts of work that should be left to humans. This will no doubt have a massive ripple effect throughout the economy, and should be managed with extreme caution. • There are numerous other examples where artificial intelligence seems to be amassing at an alarming rate, but no one is quite sure what to do with it. • Ultimately, the most devastating result of artificial intelligence is likely misuse: the ability to outsmart people, understand their needs, and adapt to them. This can be extremely dangerous, and it is currently a field that has been rapidly advancing but is often misunderstood. Too Much Is Not Enough: Too Much AIs Are Now Available The majority of artificial intelligence that is being deployed is being deployed by companies with very limited experience with AI. This is not a problem exclusive to Microsoft, Amazon, or Apple. Any AI system that can be taught to be wrong is likely to be replaced by one that is. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to incorporate AI into the physical world: there have already been several carbon nanotube AI sensors used to diagnose cancer. However, the vast majority of attempts to incorporate AI into the physical world have been by way of closed-source AI, which aremonopolized by a few companies. The most egregious example of an AI product masquerading as a product is Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which was meant to categorize photos into categories based on their similarity to their title. The final classification was an utter failure, as the classification algorithm was in fact trained to classify images of cats into categories based on their popularity on Google+, but not any photos of cats. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

deepfakes are everywhere, from virtual assistants to automated weaponry. Should money be made by selling artificial intelligence to humans? Should it go directly to the company? A proportionate amount of the AI budget should go to research and development, to make AI better each year. This is because developing an AI is hard enough without having to create a robot to do the work.  The most egregious example of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

One of the primary issues is that AIs will often be asked to do too many different kinds of work. If AIs are asked to do too many different kinds of work, what kind of consequences will that bring? AI should not be asked to do too many different kinds of jobs, but rather, should be asked to do simple, generalizations. For example, if a machine can crunch numbers equal to that of a human being, then that is what should be asked of it. Furthermore, if a machine can level cities with a single click, then that is what should be asked of it. Furthermore, if a machine can build a house out of scrap wood, then that is what should be asked of it. In the following decade or so, most AI will be built with out any human input. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that AIs will often be asked to do too many different kinds of work. If AIs are asked to do too many different kinds of work, what kind of consequences will that bring? This is often referred to as the "Bad AIs into the mainstream problem of Bad AIs not getting here?" problem. The problem with this is that it leaves out a host of other issues, such as: who will bear the cost of retraining the next generation of AIs? Education? Health care? Government funding? Any mechanism by which the money made by these facilities can be put to productive use? 

One of the primary issues is that it will often be asked to do too many different kinds of work. If AIs are asked to do too many different kinds of work, what kind of consequences will that bring? This is often referred to as the "SiliconValleyisation of AI" problem. This is a broad term that encompasses a host of issues, but is best explained by asking which fields of science are the most daft? Mechanical engineering? Chemistry? Robotics? In computer science, this would mean artificial intelligence. In computer science, an AI is anything that can understand or learn any other AI and then learn from its experiences. For example, the Google Assistant is an AI that can understand and speak any language it is taught. This is a very crude example, but it demonstrates that anything can be an AI if trained enough. In its simplest form, AI is any machine learning technique that predicts the future by testing different alternatives and then settling on a method that it prefers. There are also “narrowsoft” AIs, which are less general and less than perfect, but still useful in certain situations. For example, the Google Photos image recognition algorithm is used in Google Photos to narrow the search results it returns to the first 10,000 results it finds. This is an excellent example that you should not rule out using an AIs to narrow your search results.

One of the primary issues is that AIs will often be asked to do too many different kinds of work. If AIs are asked to do too many different kinds of work, what kind of consequences will that bring? This is often referred to as the "Shared Responsibility" problem. This is a broad term that encompasses a host of issues, but is best explained by asking which fields of science are the most daft? The field of AI has been focused on one task: to do that task, we need a robot. This is a very weak parallel, and in most cases, it is not the task that kills the robot, but the idea. Instead, the real issue is that the goal has become synonymous with the term "augmentation". In robotics, this generally refers to robots that can do simple repetitive tasks, but which are actually useful for cultural reasons. For example, imagine having a robot vacuum that could be used to teach home economics. This is a very simplistic example, but illustrates that any task that can be
====================
deepfakes are everywhere]. What will become of the people brought up in this new world? What rights will they have? How will this change the world? These are difficult questions to answer. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones.

deepfakes are evil) and it should be considered a *public* good. This does not mean everyone will get in on the action*, but it will require more work to realize that it is even possible. 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces.

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are evil. They are not a new concept, but the way in which they have been used has been to their benefit. For example, use of the nsfw theme song to theme an image board was considered too sexual a use of reappropriation, but instead helped spark interest in the image. The same can be said for rephrases of copyrighted material: instead of linking to the original work, rephrases have often linked to imitations, turning the original piece into a laughingstock. The same can be said for derivative works: instead of copying and pasting parts of another work, people have turned to rip-offs. This is not to say that no one tries to rip things, just that they are rare.

For example, take video games: after the success of Grand Theft Auto, Rockstar redesigned the game to be much more crime-like, and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. This does not mean every game should be based on a manga/anime, but rather that when the concept is attempted, there are countless implementations that are well adapted.

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are everywhere. Deepfakes are fake photographs, videos, or articles that are shared on social media to look and sound exactly how the user wants. This can be extremely dangerous, as fake news can be used by fake users to convey incorrect or false information. Examples of common examples include the following: † BuzzFeed used a photo of a naked woman and a caption that said, "pic shared to mock fb by @nude_naked." This spread through their network and led to the removal of the photo and the posting of a new one that showed a clothed woman.

‡ Tencent used a photograph of a flower to sell t-shirts depicting a severed head. The backlash was swift and widespread, and the image was immediately removed.

Not all deepfakes are bad. The buzz around K-beauty saw users post photos and videos of themselves with the goal of gaining attention and lust. This has a similar issue with the photo-shopped sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people and ultimately on the human race? Some argue that this is a good thing, as it allows people with psychiatric disorders to feel more comfortable sharing such information. However, this does not negate the fact that such information can be dangerous. In the long run, this could potentially lead to brain-computer interfaces: if brain-computer interfaces can be implanted and users are able to choose which minds to interface with, then this could be considered a full-fledged science project. This is a different matter entirely, and I do not discuss here because I do not think it applies in the same way.

HR is corrupt. If an artist or a writer gets it wrong, what do they owe? This doesn't even take into account the privacy issues of AIs being able to learn to like and respect humans. Individuals with dominant AIs are rare, but they are a danger to society if left unchecked. Any AI that can interface with humans is considered a threat, and will be pursued as such.

It is important to realize that AI is only as good as the applications it is used for. Amazon’s recruitment AI had a very narrow interest group which it was unable to win, and which it overwhelmingly targeted with extremely high rates of false positives. This points to the need to be very careful when it comes to AI. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Google’s DeepMind AI was asked to identify the best Go player in the world, and the best decision-maker in the world? The final decision-maker was not the best choice at all.

Tesla’s failure is proof that you should not underestimate the power of AI.

One of the primary problems with AI is that it is incredibly hard to relay these ideas to engineers outside academia, which leads to an explosion of “AI for Dummies”s. This is often followed by an explosion of imitators, which is why it is so important to limit the scope of imitations. Go to any gaming convention, and you will most likely find an AI tournament playing around with an AI player. This is not a good sign; it leads to imitators, which leads to even more imitations, which in turn leads to more and more failures, which is what is meant by the phrase "more and more failures". An AI is only as good as the applications of its practitioners, and the vast majority of AI research has been focused on engineering consciousness. This is largely a male-dominated field, and it is widely believed that men are more interested in winning puzzles than playing them.
