One of the primary issues is that Artificial Intelligene replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones.

One of the primary issues is that Artificial Intelligene replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that Artificial Intelligence will replace menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

One of the primary issues is that Artificial Intelligene replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones.

This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones.

One of the primary issues is that Artificial Intelligene replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

One of the primary issues is that AI is not uniform. Outdated AIs are likely to be superseded by more accurate AIs. This will lead to increased automation, but also to new problems which have not been able to be faced (e.g. why do so many jobs now require a college degree)? Furthermore, what sort of ramifications will this have on workers? Will there be a push to give all jobs to AI? This is a difficult question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

One of the primary issues is that AI is difficult to standardize. Most AI found today is classified as AIs, which is a term used to describe AI that is highly specialized and difficult to generalize to other situations. This includes Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. This is a poor practice, as it allows dangerous AIs to surface and should not be attempted. Instead, we should focus on building systems which can be refined and optimized to our specifications. This includes building AI with human-level level intelligence, which is what AI is supposed to be. AIs are often described as having a binary behavior which is either successful or unsuccessful, but this should not be confused with intelligence. Intelligence is a state, which applies regardless of whether or not a thing does anything. An AI should be able to do anything a human being can, and anything a human being can do will be refined and optimized to be as accurate and as useful as possible. This includes AI which is as intelligent as a millionth of a second. This is the kind of AI that Google is building. This is the kind of AI that will change the world. 

One of the primary issues is that AI is variable. Some AI is incapable of performing any task, and must be adapted to the environment it is placed in. This includes the military. The most common examples of this are AI for warfare, and AI to detect and neutralize terrorists. These roles do not require any intelligence, and can be implemented in the military for free. Other examples include self-driving cars, and automated deposition robots. These roles require very specialized knowledge of mathematics and artificial intelligence to implement, and most companies do not offer these services. The final major class of AI is crash-testing, which is when AI is tested to death in uncontrolled situations to see how it performs. This is a field which is rapidly growing, but is largely unexplored. The final major class of AI is crash-triage, which is when AI is tested and re-tested until it does what it was tested against. This is a rapidly growing field, but is largely unexplored.

There are also weak points in any system. When Apple introduced the first iPhone, it included a low-level low-level IMEI chip which could not be removed. This was a weak point, but could be fixed by adding a hardware security chip. This would have prevented this type of attack, but it is not without risk.

There are also many unknowns. The most basic form of an AI is not always the best idea. Consider the following AIs: • Jeopardy champions • IBM Watson • Microsoft Cognitive Analysis System • Common Pool • Q Canvas • RadBENQ • Screencast • Sun Tzu's The Art of War • Unmanned Aerial Vehicle • Volta • and Tesla Motors'. • Tesla Motors failed, and is not to be confused with Tesla coil, a coil that could only be sold in Tesla cars • What about theauri?

Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

One of the primary issues is that Artificial Intelligene replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones.

This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky.

This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments.

One of the primary issues is that Artificial Intelligene replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

One of the primary issues is that Artificial Intelligene replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that Artificial Intelligene is way more complex than a computer can possibly be. How do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should the money made go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail.

This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones.

One of the primary issues is that Artificial Intelligene replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

One of the primary issues is that Artificial Intelligene replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward.

There are several different ways that AI can be misused. The most common example is that of end-users: people who use AI to automate mundane tasks. Amazon’s Mechanical Turk system was used to house temp workers across the United States. The primary benefit to the employer was that the job was relatively low-paying, and it was also clear that the temp workers were not trained or cared for. The problem with this is that it opens the door to the pervasion of mad scientists like Stephen Hawking inventing some kind of sentient computer that will take our jobs. The Guardian’s use of the Mechanical Turk as an example showed that AI can be misused, and showed that it is not as black and white as you might think. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), and anything below 90% is considered unusable. The point of artificial intelligence is to allow humans to do more with less, and if the AI can do this by performing tasks it has been trained for, then that is the limit of its power. The most common example of an AI not performing as expected is Siri, which was meant to be an intelligent personal assistant. The final implementation was an idiot AI, who asked mostly generic questions, and no specific responses. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to create an AI to mimic elements of the mind, but this has been thwarted by several factors. The most obvious is that this would mean that everyone would be computer‐programmed, which is a very negative thought‐experiment. Secondly, it would require that humans be super‐human‐intelligent to be able to think of a thing that wasn’t human, and this is just not on anyone’s to‐do list. Finally, and most importantly, it would almost certainly lead to the downfall of the project, as artificial intelligence would then be focused on solving problems it had been trained for, and there would be no need for anyone to think outside the box.

There are also differing opinions on how to deal with AI. Some believe that AI should be kept as safe as possible, and only be sent out in small, controlled studies. This is in contrast to how things have gone in the medical field, where researchers have begun releasing dangerous and sometimes deadly drugs into the wild. This

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution?

One of the primary issues is that Artificial Intelligene replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones.

This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI
