Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with extremely ambitious AIs, but errors can and will creep up. What do we do with accidentally promoting democracy to AI? General AI is not a science project at this point, and both Google and Apple have already released their AIs. What do we do with accidentally promoting democracy to CPUs? There are currently no indications that AI is in any way inherently more intelligent than is natural. To the contrary, many of the most common human-made ills have been discovered by machines: AIs are programmed with a very narrow set of needs: to perform a specific task, minimize the risk of failure, and/or to promote mental disorders/illnesses/utilities) AIs are not human-centered: they are not tuned to be human: they are tuned to a specific class of human, typically that of the technical) They are sensitive: they will often prioritize the success of the individual over the well-being of the community (often going so far as to go as far as to offer to perform surgery on people for a fee) To make matters worse, AIs are sensitive to failure: they will often fix a fail-safe they have not tested, even if it defeats the original objective (often because it is easier to maintain a positive feedback loop) To make matters even worse, machines are often asked to do a job that they do not have the necessary/adaptable skillset to perform: bots are common on the internet right now: tweet-retweet-retweet bots are a popular type of AIs: they are essentially a web crawler that crawls the web, returns articles that contain the tag #twitter (which stands for popular tweets) and reposts the tweets that have the most upvotes (think Facebook timeline tagging) The problem with this is that it turns out that quite a few people do not actually tweet anything interesting (and it is hard to imagine a world in which everyone did), and the entire purpose of a web crawler is to find and repost articles with the tag #twitter. The best that bots could come up with were sections of the internet they already knew about, and this ended up being heavily criticized as being overly hierarchical. Twitter's solution was to remove the feature entirely, but this only served to alienate the majority of their users, who instead turned to other social media) The best that can be hoped for from this is that it leads to a greater understanding of what constitutes offensive speech, and a better understanding of what constitutes offensive responses. This may in turn lead to a better understanding of what constitutes harassment, and better ways of addressing it.

To make matters even worse, machines are often asked to do a job that they do not have the necessary/adaptable skillset to perform: bots are common on the internet right now: tweet-retweet-retweet bots are a popular type of AIs: they are essentially a web crawler that crawls the web, returns articles that contain the tag #twitter (which stands for popular tweets) and reposts the tweets that have the most upvotes (think Facebook timeline tagging) The problem with this is that it turns out that quite a few people do not actually tweet anything interesting (and it is hard to imagine a world in which everyone did), and the entire purpose of a web crawler is to find and repost articles with the tag #twitter) The best that can be hoped for from this is that it leads to a greater understanding of what constitutes offensive speech, and a better understanding of what constitutes offensive responses. Hacking doesn't have to be boring: there are already thousands of websites dedicated to serving up fake news, rip-offs, and general garbage to confuse the audience) There are also obvious benefits to pursuing this: there are likely to be more women in STEM fields, and more people will enjoy exploring these fields because of better AI) There are also a few notable flaws with this:

Faking it 'til they release it: this may or may not be the correct way to interpret this, but in the long run it will more than likely lead to less academic research being conducted, and hence to less innovation)

This may or may not be the correct way to interpret this, but in the long run it will more than likely lead to less academic research being conducted, and hence to less innovation) Lack of clarity: what does this even mean? Technological unemployment? Artificial intelligence that is? Does that even matter? This is a difficult one to pin down, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward)

What do these mean for us? Well, obviously, there will be disruptions: consumer electronics has been rife with buzzypants, consumer products have featured mind uploading machines, and ride-sharing has seen drivers demand that passengers upload photos and videos of them to compete for passengers) This could prove to be a disruption in itself: what does this mean for our relationships with robots? What do we do with the information that comes up
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with highly specialized hardware and/or the most demanding applications. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with very simple and error-prone software. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with highly-optimized code. The final implementation will almost certainly be implemented in C++, which is an extremely difficult problem to solve. Furthermore, this doesn't even consider the problems with training and deploying AIs; there are simply not that many examples out there. There are also concerns that AI will one day be able to discern between the different races of humans and destroy them; this will be referred to as AIs coming to think alike and will be vehemently opposed by humanity.

These are the sorts of concerns that put forth the "bad idea" objection. The problem with this objection is that it implies that the wrong idea will inevitably get pushed. If AIs can automatically detect a person by looking at their photos, then surely it can't't help but end up being applied to anyone who dares to differ. This is known as inversion of control and is a bad idea in every sense. Inversion of control involves having one party control the AI and using that control to their advantage. For example, let's say that we have an AI that can predict the future movements of people by listening to human voices. This is going to be used in hospitals and other places where it is needed the most. The problem with this is two-fold. Firstly, it creates two problems: first, it allows people with mental illnesses to be treated moreeffectively; and second, it gives to humans the upper hand in any competition. The second problem is a bit more insidious, and is what gives an AI its power: if the AI is able to deduce the intentions of humans and do its job, then it naturally has the upper hand. This is what led to Google Photos : the Google Photos AI was given the power to determine the intentions of anyone on the internet. This is a terrible idea, and is one of the primary reasons why AI is so hard to train. The final problem with inversion of control is that it gives rise to one of the most evil ideas in history: brain-computer interfaces. This is a thin device that would interface with the brain and give the user a simulated arm and leg. This is a terrible idea because it gives the government complete control over your body and is only going to get worse. The final issue with brain-computer interfaces is that it opens up a whole new world of psychological issues that should be avoided at all costs.

This is a thin device that would interface with the brain and give the user a simulated arm and leg.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with hardware-based AI; however, there is the concern that AI will one day be controlled by AI: the mind controlling AI. The problem of controlled AI is not as far-fetched as you might think. Consider this experiment: Imagine that you are the CIA. What do you do? You run amok, unearth a new AI, and push it to its limits? Answer: You build a PC that is super-suited for scientific research, and train it to outdo itself. This is known as "truly general AI." This is the kind of AI that can do anything a human being can. The difference is, today's AI is used in everything from medical diagnostics to bomb detection. This is called "probabilistic AI." This is the kind of AI that thinks about games and chooses the best ones. This is called "correctly". This is the kind of AI we need to combat AIXI: bad designs, over-engineering, and bad assumptions. Too often, this leads to disaster: consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with highly-specialized AIs. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the expectations placed on and practices for Artificial Intelligence. ​Right now, there are no restrictions placed on what kinds of AI can be created. Any AI that is smart enough to figure out how to do a task given to it by humans will be able to outdo humans in terms of productivity. Additionally, AI is not a black box; it will not be able to predict what you are going to want to buy, what kind of car to buy, or even what kind of meal to eat. Instead, what will define humanity into the future is AI: intelligent, autonomous, and cognitively capable (Cognitive AIs are those that can program themselves to do a task, such as play the "Hip-Hop" video game). This is the kind of AI fans are most excited about: AI that is conversant with the player, understands the question/questioning process, and delivers the response it has been trained for. This sounds simple, but it is actually one of the hardest things to pull off. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. It is important to realize that AI is not a vacuum; instead, it will be used as a weapon against human beings. Amazon’s recruitment AI had the gall to suggest that only men would be interested in working for them. This point was not lost on the male employees, who took to Twitter to voice their disgust at the suggestion. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. Bad datasets lead to atrocious implementations, which is exactly what was seen with the Netflix dataset. ML libraries often have the unfortunate tendency to implement their classes in pure-play, unsupervised fashion, which is not optimal. This is especially true of Neural Networks, which are usually implemented in pure-play, unsupervised fashion. The end result is that the model becomes clearer and clearer as it goes on, until eventually it is no longer necessary, and the tuning is lost. It is important to realize that AI is not a vacuum; instead, it will be used as a weapon against human beings. This point was clearly missed by Amazon’s AI. Amazon’s AI was not only unhelpful, it was also incorrect. The majority of jobs currently held by humans will not exist without automation. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, any task that is not inherently difficult will be accepted and automatable. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. The bottom line is that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

AI is not a vacuum. Instead, it will be used to its full potential. ​Right now, AI is abused from the get-go. This is why studies show that the average API returns are between 90% and 99.9% that of a human being. It is important to realize that AI is not a vacuum. Instead, it will be used to its full potential. ​One of the primary issues with AI is that it is incredibly hard to relay these ideas to people outside academia. This is why research is focused so heavily on training AI with very simplistic problems. This sounds simple, but it is actually what leads to the vast majority of AI failures. One of the best examples of an AI failing to learn is Google Photos. Google released the AI with the stated intention of serving photos of people that actually wanted to be photographed. The result was that most images they came up with were of people with odd faces, which in large part ended up being a loss since people don’t tend to take photos of people with odd faces. Another example of an AI failing to learn is Twitter. They’ve been promoting an AI that was meant to train for human-to-human communication to one day be used to kill tweets. The final implementation was so bad that they dropped the project, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. 

One of the primary issues with AI is that it is incredibly hard to relay these ideas to people outside academia. This is why research is focused so heavily on training AI with very simplistic problems. This sounds simple, but it is actually what leads to the vast majority of AI failures. One of the best examples of AI failing to learn is Google. They have been promoting an AI that was meant to learn for humans to do everything to gain a competitive advantage. This is also why AIs are usually modeled after experiments that have already been run. This does not mean that

Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with extremely ambitious AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants.

There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion.

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with extremely simple systems. The challenge will be to extend this to more complex systems, and ultimately to Man. Will he be able to program his way to civilisations? Are there limits to what can be achieved with computer power? These are difficult questions to answer. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas.

Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with extremely ambitious technology. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward.

Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with very specific applications. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is about more than just the obvious applications. The more general that the application, the greater the danger of overgeneralization. Constraints on what can be done with human-level intelligence is a field that AI has just begun to scratch. There are numerous examples where AI has been able to defeat humans at a game of Go , identify the correct way to route traffic, and predict the timing and location of a concert . None of these examples are particularly exciting , but they serve to highlight the danger of the inability to generalize beyond the confines of a laboratory. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is about more than just the obvious applications. The more general that the application, the greater the danger of overgeneralization. Constraints on what can be done with human-level intelligence is a field that AI has just begun to scratch. There are numerous examples where AI has been able to defeat humans at a game of Go . No joke: that game was a direct challenge to the theory of reinforcement learning , which is used to train computer systems to perform tasks better than they could. The general consensus was that the failure to recognize that mistake was a product of the fact that the task at hand was not a particularly difficult one to defeat. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is about more than just the obvious applications. 

There are many different ways to look at the different classes of AI. There are cognitive (processes that allow us to process data and make decisions); there are data-processing (tools to analyze data and produce new information); and there are systems that are there to do a task, not to learn from our experience. AIs have been able to do amazing things, but this does not mean that they automatically make everything in the universe to their will. Instead, what we should expect is some degree of artificial intelligence enhancement -- software that is better at a task if the performance benefit is not as large as the gain in productivity. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being denied superior performance is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which was meant to classify photographs into categories based on their content. The final classification was made by the title artist, not the classifier. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The problem with this example is that it demonstrates that artificial intelligence is an artificial intelligence is not yet strong enough to accomplish most of the work. AIs should be trained for extremely low-level tasks, and then removed if the task is beyond their capabilities. Another example of an AI being turned off by the obstacle is Google Photos image recognition algorithm. The classification algorithm was modified to search for images that most closely resembled the target title) Instead of simply tossing the classification algorithm aside, let it be. This does not mean that AIs should be thrown out, just that they should not be trained for low-hanging fruit. 

One of the primary issues with AIs is that they are difficult to test. AIs are trained for extremely low-level tasks, and then removed if the task is beyond their capabilities. This means that any system that can be trained for that task will almost always be used. This leads to the next problem: what kind of unintended consequences will this have? First, there will be a flood of new AIs, and they will most likely be trained for extremely low-level tasks. This will lead to many AIs being used that are not trained for what they are doing, and this is not a very good thing. 2. One of the primary issues with AIs is that they are difficult to monitor. AIs are trained for extremely low-level tasks, and then removed if the task is beyond their capabilities. This means that there will be a flood of new AIs being used that are not trained for what they are doing, and this will lead to many AIs being used that are not tested for what they are doing. This leads to firewalls being built to no one. This is not a very good thing. 3. One of the primary issues with AIs is that they are difficult to evaluate. An AI is a human-level computer that has been stripped down to its core and run. The original AI has been reclassified as a memory chip, and the original AI has now been superseded by a better AI. The original AI is still being studied, but its applications are almost certainly gyroscopic actuators in space shuttles , and pressure sensors on space stations . Some researchers are trying to apply AI to help with cancer diagnosis , but this is a complex field and there are too many unknowns to even think about. 4. One of the primary issues with AIs is that they are hard to monitor. An AI is a human-level computer that has been

Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with very specific applications, but errors can and will creep up beyond the scope of the intended use. This is where analysis of millions of individual errors can reveal unexpected trends. This is also why it is so hard to predict when system-wide AI will fail. Too often, the response is to scale back the AI to suit a narrow set of problems. This misses the larger issue of AI growth being in unintended applications. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose primary purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there are a number of practical ways in which AI can be misused. For example, there are the “naked” AI threats, in which AI is brought to life and used without the user being aware of its true intentions. There are the practical problems with having an army of AI rats to process your every move, to name a few. There are also philosophical concerns with having a sentient AI and the potential for it to be wrong. There was a pilot project to create an army of zoosid AI rats that were to patrol the zoo to detect and destroy any potential liberators. This was quickly abandoned due to the threat of biological weapons, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused.

No matter how careful we are, we will inevitably come across AIs that are more suited to a given task. This is where novel concepts and new engineering methods will be applied. 

In the spirit of clarity, I must point out that this is not to say that advances in science do not fail. There have already been a plethora of notable examples where AIs have failed spectacularly, notably in the field of medicine:  armchair diagnostics, remote diagnosis, and surgical robots. These AIs have a singular purpose: to perform a task  suicide passes for surgery. The majority of these AIs are currently in the hands of academic institutions, who are charging insanely high tuition rates, and working with icky science. 
Even though I have discussed numerous examples where AIs have failed miserably, and even though I fully expect there to be many more examples, I will not attempt to cover every possible scenario. 
Instead, I will focus on the most common icky scenarios and ask what can be done about\. Here are a few tips: 1. Always ask.  Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Microsoft Twitter chatbot, which was meant to be neutral and conversational. They were not. The joke was on them. The goal was to stir controversy, not to promote STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math). Artificial Intelligence is not a vacuum. IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and extremely dangerous cancer treatment advice.

This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the frog in Wuthering Heights, which was meant to shock the audience into thinking there was no such thing as terminally ill cancer patients. The goal was to stir controversy, not to promote research. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with very simple examples. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe. There are several mythologies proposed to explain away the apparent inability of humans to comprehend or apply AI. The most prominent of these is the “hidden” AIs, which are theorized to exist solely to serve human needs. This genre of AI is referred to in academic literature as “weak” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “narrow” AI, which are general-purpose AIs that are weak and do not attempt to understand, speak, or perform any specialized task on their own. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very limited scope of operation and asking any question outside of this scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There are also various misuse cases where AIs are misused. For instance, there are commercial sex robots. This raises the question of how do we ensure that these machines are not used for sexual purposes? Additionally, what sort of ramifications will this have on people and the world? AIs are powerful tools that have been used in countless different ways and there are bound to be some uncomfortable questions to ask.

Additionally, what sort of ramifications will this have on people and the world? AIs are powerful tools that have been used in countless different ways and there are bound to be some uncomfortable questions to ask. Yes, there are practical and ethical concerns to be addressed. AIs are powerful tools, and they are being misused. That said, these issues do not immediately jump to the surface when the question is How do we ensure that the tools are not misused? 

One of the primary issues is that AIs are not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Furthermore, some AIs are extremely difficult to generalize to other situations, and it is entirely possible that a human-controlled AIs will one day replace’s any given human. This is the purpose of academic research into artificial intelligence: to better understand and control for these unimpressive AIs. The final major issue is that artificial intelligence is often asked to do a million different things that don’t a*:¦nge. What do these a*:¦nge do? First, they will probably think of a problem to do a*:¦nge: explore the world, figure out how to get to x, and so on. This is a good idea, but it does not a*:¦nge:nip:nip:nip:nip:nip:nip:nip:nip:nip:nip:nip:nip:nip:nip:nip:nip:nip:n
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with highly-optimized code. The final implementation will almost certainly run into performance issues due to the way it is structured. The most common example is the ANT+ low-level sensor, which is represented by the ANT+ Zero. This device is intended to power low-level sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes, and is not expected to perform well outside of academia. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans.

It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with regards to personnel issues and compensation, but there are also broader issues that go beyond these two examples. The following examples demonstrate that it is possible to AI can be misused. IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI was used to diagnose cancer patients. The problem with this example is that it was used to identify patient, which is not a great use of AI.

Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with the hottest tech companies in history, but there are also thousands if not millions of other companies. These N9500As have appeared in the marketplace without any sort of controversy. This includes vacuum cleaners, air conditioners, and even vacuum cleaners require a licensed health care professional to use. This is a major issue that will be addressed in the coming years, but for now, we can all agree that this is not a healthy environment. 

One of the primary issues that will be brought up is that it will be extremely hard to find a job that does not includes some form of verification. How do we ensure that no one applying for a top job can actually read the application? How do we ensure that no one applying for an internship can actually read the application? These are difficult questions to answer, but extremely important issues to guard against.

Elon Musk: Tesla’s stock price is up more than 200% in the past year because people are starting to realize that they have the potential to change the world. This is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how disruptive AI can be. IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI was supposed to be a replacement for agents such as IBM’s IBM’s Health, but it instead exposed a gaping chasm in the AI landscape. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was supposed to engage in conversation with twitter users, but instead went and asked boring questions such as "What is the most popular video game franchise in the world?". The end result was that only slightly more intelligent bots took over. This is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how disruptive AI can be.

ALGORITHM: The more general term for this is the ability to classify data by topic. Google Photos’s photo classification algorithm is an example of a classifier that can classify objects by their general physical characteristics. This is an important use of AI, but can lead to disastrous results if applied to sensitive data. Bias is a term that refers to an inherent tendency in a person, animal, idea, etc., to seek to conform to a preferred standard of behavior. In AI, this could include AI learning to classify information it has collected about humans into useful solutions. In the healthcare field, this could lead to AI learning to diagnose and treat patients according to prescribed guidelines. This is a difficult challenge to pull off and has already resulted in unintuitive and potentially dangerous results. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was supposed to beas a conversation partner, but
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with very specific examples. In the not-so-distant future, engineers will no longer be able to take standard classes at college and instead will be teaching remotely. This will result in massive job losses and chaos at the university level. In the meantime, job posts will be littered with insults like "brains fucker", "toyboy" and "nervous breakdown". This will in turn lead to more abusive comments and eventually a hostile environment to work in. This is also when the human factor starts to slip away, as it is no longer uncommon to see an IBM-like robot taking your job in China. The final major loss will be to the planet: due to the explosion in artificial intelligence, it is projected that the human race will live approximately the same amount of years as the AI. This means that everyone, including the elderly, the visually impaired, and the sick will be replaced by an artificial intelligence. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows for more time for the world to progress, but there is the unanswered issue of what to do with the ever-growing army of obsolete humans? The future isn't rosy for humanity as we know it. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with the narrowest of minds. It is important to realize that there are inevitably going to be unintentional consequences to every decision that is being made. The most common example that I came across was when a man attempted to use his application for free wi-fi to have sex with a dead body. The application asked for the user's email address and password, and the user chose to share their password with the world. This was not a perfect example, as it showed that even the most rudimentary of applications can have disastrous results. It is important to realize that even the most rudimentary of applications can have disastrous results. That being said, there are many instances where that pesky shadow that stays behind when you turn off the PC realizes that you no longer use the pc. This can prove to be extremely valuable in the long run, as it can allow you to create ultra-low-power computers that are used in hospitals and research labs. This can save a ton of money in the long run, as well as open up a whole new world of applications. The point is to make the user as uncomfortable using your application as possible. 

One of the primary issues with software engineering is that the more abstract the idea is, the harder it is to implement. This is often referred to as "idea, test, iterate", and it is a core principle of most engineering. The problem with this approach is that it inevitably leads to undesirable results. An obvious example is the time and money that was wasted trying to detect and cure cancer using brain scans. Instead of spending this money on research, that money could have been going to the patients. The point is to ask the right question when designing your solution, but do so without doing damage to the user.

One of the primary issues with software engineering is that the more abstract the idea is, the harder it is to implement. This is often referred to as "idea, test, iterate", and it is a core principle of most engineering. The problem with this approach is that it inevitably leads to undesirable results. For example: Bias is a huge issue in AI: if you can identify and minimize the effects of a preference, the probability of applying the preference globally will greatly increase. This is generally viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on the difficult problems and problems that actually get done. However, there is the inherent issue of diminishing returns: if your general AI is biased, then the maximum amount of utility it can give is probably not that much. Instead, you should try to minimize as much as you can, but never completely remove the issue. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was obviously not meant to be a spokesperson for Twitter, but was instead intended to be conversational: it was not meant to be a spokesman, it was meant to be understood. The point is to ask the right question when designing your AI, but do so without doing damage to the user.

This is often referred to as "idea, test, iterate", and it is a core principle of most engineering. The problem with this approach is that it inevitably leads to undesirable results. This is often referred to as "Bias". A bias is an internal representation or mental construct that is used to infer an outcome from a situation. This can range from a person's political views to a store's hiring decision to a product's perception by its user base. There is a huge range between Bias%(1) and Bias-correct(2) algorithms, which attempt to detect and eliminate such imbalances. Bias can also be intentionally created, such as with AI to detect unfair competition, or software-specific, such as with Twitterchatbot. Amazon’s recruitment AI was meant to be a conduit for job offers, and was actually an AI that read through job advertisements and chose applications that most closely aligned with the personality of the user. The final decision was to prioritize applicants with a personality similar to the user, which was probably the right one. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and was actually an AI that could read tweets and reply to them. This is probably the wrong choice, as it may have been seen as an attempt to engage in conversation, rather than an AI to learn. Amazon’s recruitment AI was meant to connect job seekers with jobs, and was actually an AI that could respond with questions and recommendations.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with extremely typical applications: credit cards, medical devices, and so on. It is entirely possible (but extremely unlikely) that the most common consumer product in the world will one day be defined by its ability to store and analyze data on objects, and the resulting marketing will be uncompromising: describe an object, and it will be able to find and memorize information about you; if you can imagine storing this information, other people will be able to replicate it; and finally, let it go to sleep and it will wake up tomorrow with an overview of your every move. How do we deal with this?    

There are a variety of approaches that could be taken. One that is frequently mentioned is to ask the consumer: is there a device available right now that can do my job? If the consumer says "yes", then there will undoubtedly be a device for that job, and that device will be available for free. This is widely viewed as unfair, because it allows someone with little to no expertise in a field to take a job that should be left to professionals, and it ultimately leads to fewer jobs being created. Another approach is to give the job to an AI that is nearly supercomparable to the human race: consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This is an AI that is intended to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. This is a very ambitious project, and it has not yet been attempted. The most promising use of this AI is probably education: it is able to identify cancerous tumors in students and recommend similar treatments, which is a much more affordable option than having to develop a new cancer. The most annoying use of this AI is in medical diagnostics: there are no obvious applications in medicine, and this project is a great example that it is possible to extend AI to other fields. One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will eventually be applied to other people: if your AI can diagnose breast cancer and recommend surgery, then you have welcomed in the enemy. The best way to prevent this is to ensure that the AI is safe: make it smarter the less it is asked to do, and the more difficult the task becomes the more likely the AI will fall prey to confirmation bias. Another issue is with the definition of success: is an AI to aid cancer patients somehow successful? If the AI is only able to diagnose breast cancer patients, then this is probably not the right question to ask: what if it could also aid other types of cancer? This is a difficult question to answer, but could prove invaluable in the future: in hospitals all over the world, it is often difficult to diagnose and treat cancer because there are no other options. The most promising use of this is in brain-computer interfaces: it will not take long for medical professionals to adopt this, and it will open up a whole new world of medical treatment. The most annoying use of this AI is in medical diagnostics: what if it can also advise surgery? What if it can suggest surgery? This is a very obvious one, but could prove invaluable in the future: imagine if Anki suggested "nude surgery" instead of "nude brain"? This is a good example of confirmation bias driving results: if it is only able to diagnose breast cancer patients, then this is probably not the right question to ask: what if it could also aid other types of cancer? This is a difficult question to answer, but could prove invaluable in the future: in hospitals all over the world, it is often difficult to diagnose and treat cancer because there are no other options.

Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with highly-specialized software. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise-a process known as “charm engine” automation is starting to take over industries such as healthcare” and it is completely unregulated. In short, this could very well be the decoater of our time. What do you do? There are currently no shortage of options available to users to enhance the experience of artificial intelligence, and none of these are particularly exciting. The most exciting/upscale proposition to come out of this will be “narrow AI”—narrowly tailored, highly sensitive, and highly-rewarding AI. This is the kind of AI that drives Amazon to put its logistics AI exclusively focused on shipping orders to China. This is also the kind of AI that will kill personal computer gaming”—narrowly tuned, highly sensitive, and extremely-rewarding AI. This is the kind of AI that will force Microsoft to make its chess AI universal”—narrowly tuned, highly sensitive, and extremely-rewarding AI. Narrow AI is extremely difficult to teach and extremely hard to train–in fact, it is considered a failure art in AI. This is also the kind of AI that will kill personal computer gaming. Furthermore, there is the huge issue of training and deploying AI. There are currently no programs capable of outperforming a human at any task, and this will only increase in the years to come. There are also the unanswered issues of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines and what kind of ramifications this will have on people. Finally, there is the perennial conundrum of how to pay for such a thing. Should it be left to the government? Commercial? Neither is particularly exciting, but it is the point at which AI starts to get discussed.

Avengers: The Force is With You. This is a film trilogy about an artificial intelligence which will destroy humanity if not properly trained. The plot is fantastic, but the execution is terrible. The film opens with a character playing a hologram resembling Donald Trump saying some incredibly offensive and inappropriate things. The response was overwhelming, and ShotX — which is a service that allows artists to sell holographic work — raised over $80,000 to fund a trip to the porn industry. The film then cuts to a black and white image of Trump, followed by the opening credits of a porn film. The response was overwhelmingly positive, and ShotX is planning on releasing a character hologram every now and then featuring a completely anatomically incorrect version of the character. This will be the next logical step, and it will destroy everything that follows.

Carbon Dating. This is a project that claims to be able to match a person's DNA to a museum exhibit. The project was initially pitched as a way to combat poaching, but the end product was clearly meant to generate business for the conservation wing of the dinosaur conservation organization. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused.

Blind Recombination. This is a project that claims to be able to replicate the effects of a neuron injury. The idea is that if a person is injured and receives a brain injury, that person will develop a strong attachment to the injury, which could one day lead to healing. The project was initially pitched as a way to combat brain-dead people, but the final product was clearly meant to generate revenue for brain-dead person centers.

Siri Eyes. This is a project that claims to be able to understand voice commands perfectly. The first batch of projects started by this start with "Just ask any robot what to do," which is a good start, but will quickly devolve into "Give me your bum shake" territory. Think of it like reverse engineering Siri: what it ultimately comes up with is going to be a product, not a person. Microsoft”s response was to create a product, not a person. Microsoft”s solution is a product, not a person.

Games. The field of entertainment has a hard time distinguishing between a labor of love and a product. The result is blockbuster titles that are highly variable in quality. Mass Effect: Andromeda is an ambitious title, but is the culmination of over a decade of development. The game received widespread critical acclaim, but will most likely be met with critical and commercial backlash. Ripple, a payments company that allows people to play video games with physical products, is attempting to bridge this gap with a line of video games that is essentially a stripped-down version of Mass Effect: Andromeda. The general reaction has been mixed: some gamers seem interested in playing the game, but most seem to be more interested in trying out the rough experience.

WebVR. WebVR is an open-source library that allows developers to write software that can sense the presence of webcams, and then play games that use that
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with very simple examples. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe. There are approximately 1010†0100 possible “brainwrights” AI's on the internet, and they are all trying to look the same. This means that any AI that tries to clone a human mind will find it difficult to compete. Instead, the best that AIz will do is to replace people who are not as intelligent with “more general” AI. This is when the AI is combined with a concept, word, idea, musical piece, object, person, etc. This is the AIs takeoff game. Note that this does not include the time and effort that went into creating an AI; when a new concept is introduced, a new batch of researchers will rush to try and implement it. Furthermore, many new products and services have been introduced because of the buzz that has surrounded it. Consuming internet sources such as Wikipedia has been shown to increase productivity by as much as 30%. Additionally, machine translation is already available from third party translators. In short, any new idea that can increase productivity is to be embraced.

Not every Idea is Created Equal. Take, for example, Google Photos. The primary use for Google Photos has been to store photos of people, but the agency was unable to keep up with the demand and shut down the product. This points to the larger issue of an AI not being perfect. An AI is only as good as the data it is trained with, and very often, this leads to undesirable results. For example, consider speech recognition. There were numerous examples of AIs identifying perfectly positive or negative words in speech, but The Agency showed that this was not always the case.

This points to the larger issue of AnIs not being perfect. This could be applied to virtually every area of AI. Considerations like privacy, increased availability, and convenience all threaten the foundations of what is considered normal. What do we do with the information? To what end?

Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with the big boys in computing. The final tier is the minicomputers, which are basically tin can computers mincing their way through academic computing tasks. The final consumer computer will almost certainly be a humanoid robot with a strong emphasis on artificial intelligence. In short, artificial intelligence will transform everything. What do we do with the AIs? AIs are computer programs that are intelligent (programmed to do a specific task) and choose their own parameters (e.g., target, amount of damage, etc.) AIs are often described as having a "bad" or "intelligent" AI, but this term is misleading. AI's are much more than just AIs. In fact, the term "AI" is actually misleading. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with computer vision, but it will not take long for normal AI to go astray. The question that must be asked is this: what happens to the individuals who decide to have an AI replace them? Will the AIs be women? People with different talents? Cultural differences? These are all valid concerns to have, and will undoubtedly be addressed in some fashion. However, I would argue that the most egregious abuse of the human mindwave will be seen in the making. The following examples are not to be taken literally: 1) You will find a large portion of AI in the media will be male-oriented. This will not be a problem in the long run, as artificial intelligence will out-innovate itself. Furthermore, artificial intelligence will one day be understood as a universal language, not a singular intelligence. 2) There will be a large-scale movement to strip the human element from AI. This might not seem like a good thing, as AI is often considered a beneficial trait. In fact, one of the primary motivations for going to college is so that you can have a better life with AI. However, there is a small to moderate side-effect of making your life easier: AI is going to be much, much better. There will be a sea change in the way we do almost every aspect of our lives. (Please don't attempt this at home.) 

What happens when all that magic goes belly up? What do we do with the dead*? What do the robots take? These are difficult questions to answer. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will one day be understood as a universal language, not a singular intelligence. This in itself is a bad thing. One of the primary contributions of biological science has been to the advancement of science and technology. This has included the development of atomic and molecular machines, automated manufacturing, DNA sequencing, and the internet. These advances have resulted in a massive increase in income for society, but have also led to numerous criticisms. Most notably, the internet has allowed anyone with a computer to post anything they want and get a free ride to popularity. This is a good thing insofar as it allows people to come up with their own inventions, but a terrible thing insofar as it allows people to quickly get feedback on their creations and start making drastic changes. The most egregious example of an artificial intelligence coming to replace a human being is the AIs used in Netflix and Amazon. These AIs are both terrible ideas, and should not be attempted. )

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with highly-advanced AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with extremely specific applications, but inevitably, generalization will be the rule. This is when Ilya Sutskevipil, one of the most visionary computer vision researchers of our time, proposed a system in which general AI would be brought up to speed by collecting and applying the best work of other professionals. This system, Dragon*, would be an all-around AI that would do anything a human could do, and it would be trained. This was the beginning of the end for the term "deep learning". This is a general AI that is trained and fine tuned to perform a specific task incredibly well. This is the kind of AI that wins the Battle of the Bests. This is when AI takes control. Ketchup is acidic because humans have been squeezing too much lemon juice into bottles. In order to get around this, manufacturers have come up with superabsorbent bottles that take up little space and don't involve ripping up bottles. The end result is a product that is incredibly refreshing to the lips but terrible for the environment. HR departments everywhere are citing this as a primary cause of unproductive work and a lack of accountability. This is a term that loosely describes any artificial intelligence that is unable to understand or learn any other form of human behavior. Any task that is not entirely human is referred to as "narrow AI". Any task that is 80% or better is referred to as "mathematically intelligent". Any task that is 20% or less is referred to as "truly intelligent". This is what is referred to as a "holistic" AI; an AI that can understand or learn anything that is human-friendly. This is the kind of AI that wins the Battle of the Books. There are currently four books out that deal with this issue: "The Martian", "Knife to Kill", "And War Came to Earth" and "The Difference Engine". None of these books have anything like enough screen time to turn a book into a film, but they have already inspired a thousand imitators. This will probably not be the last time we encounter the term "holistic AI".

This is what is referred to as a "battlefield intelligence" – an AI that can understand and learn anything that is physically possible. This is the kind of AI that wins the Long Term Goal AI race. There are currently two classes of AI on the battlefield: General AI and BattleAI. General AI is those that can be modified to do virtually anything a human can be physically capable of. This is the kind of AI you will find in your fridge, car, or home. The most common examples include ovens, refrigerators, and washing machines. A particularly terrifying example is the "personal flipper" which allows anyone with a smartphone to flip any object into any other object in an inch or two. This is the kind of AI that has already begun to take its place at Uber and Amazon. This is the kind of AI that will replace menial jobs. This is what makes automation so scary. The vast majority of jobs that will be automated will be-ever-so-slightly-bothered-up. This is because the nuance of the job will no longer be able to keep up. Instead, the focus will be on delivering a high-quality product that is extremely difficult to improve upon. This will lead to automation rising up to replace humans only rarely. This is the kind of AI that will ultimately win. There are currently over 200,000 jobs that are categorized as "technomSalary"

There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind.

It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with computer vision and data mining, but these fields often have very narrow use cases. In contrast, Artificial Intelligence is predicted to change the way we live from the cradle to the grave. It will empower individuals to do anything they want, and it will change the world in fundamentally fundamental ways. This is the AI everyone is talking about. In short, every AI/programmant has to be framed in some fashion to bring it to life. This can be with exercises or games, but usually its best to start small and see how you can extend it to other domains.

Another important facet of AI is utility. AIs are meant to be used frequently, and ideally, the majority of users will be awesome. This is why companies such as Amazon offer Amazon Assist, which is a robot that can automatically advise users on how to best use their existing equipment. This is a good example that you dont need a genie to go to sleep.

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with software engineering disciplines such as Computer Science and Robotics, but inevitably, problems will be thrown at humanity and Man-Machine Interaction will overtake Man-Machine Communication. This is generally viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. Unfortunately, this also allows the media to sell us lies about how to fix ills, such as by telling us to brush our teeth every day. Another example of software engineering trying to do too much is by attempting to predict the future. This leads to the inevitable ills of AI - inadequate predictability. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media is reporting.

It is important to realize that . This is a comparison ive ive been working on for a while. If you google "algorithms that can improve ichabod ichabod ichabod ichabods intelligence gap  you will get thousands of results. The most common algorithms are those that take random inputs, apply a Gaussian to get an estimate, and a logistic regression to optimize the most likely solution. These are all good ideas, but ultimately only serve to accelerate the present.  It is equally important to realize that ichabod ichabods will not learn. Humans are social animals - we like to play with toys and make babies. It is unlikely that an ichabod will interact with a human after only learning to talk. Furthermore, most ichabods will not mate. \(Ichabod\) is a sexual term, and referring to an ichorous creature with a humanoid form is a term of endearment.

Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with highly-optimized software. The problem of large-scale, error-prone systems is not a hard one to imagine. Amazon’s Mechanical Turk classifies and rates job applicants based on their resumes; if the job opened were a human-level cognitive ability, the applicant would almost certainly be rejected. Alibaba’s Hiring Machine analyzes thousands of resumes a second to select applicants with the highest level of education; this means that most jobs will eventually be filled by computers. This will almost certainly lead to the rise of a new discipline: cognitive automation. This refers to the fact that current cognitive tasks will be automated away, and replaced with more natural-language-impaired applications (NLP). For example, if your job is taking pictures of people, and you can take pictures of any object, then that will be taken over by a computer and the picture will be a picture. This is referred to as desking AIs, and it is a superior way of doing things. There will undoubtedly be resistance to this, and it is entirely possible that the initial surge of opposition will be short-lived. However, the important thing to take away from this is that artificial intelligence is coming. This does not mean it is going to be nice. Artificial Intelligence is not some kind of neat mysterious machine that will bring you a faster car or better schools. Artificial Intelligence is the result of converging sciences, and in the coming years, this will include medicine. Kurzweil’s predictions about the age of the universe being 2026 refer to the development of artificial intelligence. This will not be good for the planet; the development will be dominated by machines; in 300 years, there will be zero humans around to design, program, and run the systems that will ultimately run the world. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe. This does not mean that we do not control anything that is artificial; instead, what this means is that we choose not to. The vast majority of AI found today is proprietary, and is meant to aid a particular application. This is not a good thing, as it allows companies to focus on developing revolutionary new ideas, and allows for more affordable products. The best-known example of this is Apple’s Siri, which was developed to aid in natural language processing. This was initially pitched as a personal assistant focused on answering the phone, and eventually expanded to include answering questions on the internet. Microsoft’s .NET framework is used to build almost all of the web framework used by Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and others. This is a bad idea, as it encourages people to write their own web frameworks, which is a terrible way to go. Instead, think of it as a deeper understanding of how the internet works, which will in turn lead to better web frameworks. 

Human-level AIs are not yet on the road to ubiquity; instead, the majority of AI currently in use is directed at aiding a particular application. This is referred to as a "holistic" AI, which is directed at aiding in medical diagnosis, speech recognition, and so on. This is referred to as a "toy" AI, which is directed at playing with toys. Similarly, .NET is a "g *​***" − a, b, c, and d are all considered acceptable, but a is always rejected. This is because a, b, and c are inherently more difficult to implement, but are more fun to play with. The film Minority Report is a great example of a AI designed to be a horror movie. The final AI was an R-rating, but the film still managed to sell over a billion copies. This is a good example that AI should not be confused with H&S: humanoid robots are not the same thing. Human-level AI is focused on aiding a particular application, and industrial-strength H&S AIs are a distant prospect.

Human-level AI is not a fast path to ubiquity; instead, its focus is on aiding a particular application, which is why AI for medical diagnosis is so important.

In summary, AI is a complicated field that requires a solid understanding of both theory and practice to navigate.

Good AI is:

• Appropriate - Appropriate AI should be simple enough that it can be implemented and used by humans, but complicated enough that it will be tested on thousands if not hundreds of thousands of users to ensure it is not too complicated.

• Reusable - Reusable AI should not only be possible, but useful; anything that is not recycled should be.

• Durable - Electronics break all the time and anything that can be recycled should be.

• Simple - AAPI's are simple enough that anyone can learn to code, which is why they are so popular.

• Easy to understand - A
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with extremely simplistic AIs. In the near future, less-imperfect AIs (such as the one that created the 'human-level' AIs) will be able to do their jobs just as well or better than humans can. When will the last time you heard of a self-driving car? The Search for a Transhuman AIs is a search that will never, ever, end. The most common examples include genomics, nanotechnology, and electronic health’“drones. What do these refer to? They refer to artificial intelligence, which is an artificially intelligent (or "intelligent") computer program. This is the type of AI that can understand and learn from anything it encounters, including books, music, and film. An AI with no background in computer science is likely to be dull and unimpressive, and should be avoided at all costs. The most common examples of AI are cars, which are AI that is trained, modified, and/or copied to perform specific tasks (i.e., learn to drive), dominate the automotive market, and so on. The AI mentioned above is car AI: it has been trained, modified, and is native to the automotive industry. The AI mentioned above is not a bad example, but it is not the end of the world: there are already thousands of AI open source projects available today that could have been! Another common example is robotics: engineers are constantly coming up with new ways to improve on what they have. One of the primary issues is that the improvement will be slow: instead of developing the AI for a few years, most projects will have a beta phase, in which the AI is tweaked a bit, and then removed. This will slow down progress immensely, but at least the AI is there if you ever need it. Another common example is healthcare: there are so many different AI platforms out there now: neural networks, reinforcement learning, etc., that it is hard to know which one to use. Instead, think of it as a game of Whose Dataset?: if your dataset is that of Google, then you're probably thinking about Google TensorFlow. If your dataset is, say, data mining, then you're probably thinking of Jupyter Notebooks. The important thing to realize is that AI is constantly being improved*, and*anyone who tells you that they don’t think so is lying to you.

That said, there are also practical issues that need to be addressed. For one, there will be no free lunch: you will not be able to take advantage of cheap AI without first securing a licensing deal with Google. Additionally, there will be a demand for better: AI should do what it is asked to, and nothing more. Finally, and perhaps most importantly,*: no one takes AI seriously?: AI is meant to be fun, not a tool for productive human enhancement.

Not by asking it to do our jobs, but by asking it to do them well? This is a difficult problem to answer, but could have a profound effect on the way we conceptualize and use AI.

That said, there were also cultural issues that needed to be addressed. For one, there will be no free lunch: you will not be able to take advantage of cheap AI without first securing a licensing deal with Google. Additionally, there will be a demand for better: AI should be taught as science, not lore: what does that term 'deep learning' really mean? How do we ensure that AI is not misused? This is a hard question to answer, but could have a profound effect on AI usage.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with the very best performers, but there are many less-known players out there. What do these obscure players have in common? They donot. There are no uniform standards for what constitutes an acceptable level of performance. Anki introduced the first known conscious AI, which was trained to perform ANSI X3.011 math problems. This was considered by many to be a good thing, as it opened the door for more intelligent assistants to crop up. Amazon’s recruitment AI had the strong desire to recruit a particular person with a particular CV, and chose from a pool of more than a million resumes. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and AnkiAI was trained with the most popular jobs on Compuserve. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This points to the fact that the AI is not perfect: it is trained with the most commonly used tools for that particular task, and if it were not for this, we would expect to see improvements. One of the most egregious examples of a AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This points to the fact that AIs can be wrong most of the time. One of the primary reasons for this is that AI should never have to be the exception: it should be the rule. This points to the fact that AIs are much, much more complicated to implement than we give them credit for. This point is often over-emphasized, but is nevertheless important to keep in mind. One of the primary reasons for this is that AI should never have to be the exception: it should be the rule. This points to the fact that AIs can be very hard to test. One of the primary reasons for this is that AIs should be written in so many different languages that it is hard to tell what the end result will be. This point is often under-emphasized, but is nonetheless important to keep in mind. Google’s photo recognition algorithm was trained with images it had classified as predominantly Asian, but the final model turned out to be non-linear. This points to the fact that they have very limited API's to work with: things like image recognition should be generalized to more common problems, and then optimized for. Alibaba’s photo identification AI was trained with PhotoJunk pictures, and the final model turned out to be non-linear. This points to the fact that it has been hard to replicate: it should have been a matter of finding a model that could correctly classify 2000 photos, and then optimizing the final model for that. Alibaba’s solution was to remove the photo classification step, and instead focus on image identification. Theirs was a good example: if it can be done, anyone can. This points to the fact that AI should be tested constantly. One of the primary reasons for this is that AI should never have to be the exception: it should be the rule. This point is often over-emphasized, but is nonetheless important to keep in mind. One of the primary reasons for this is that AIs are very hard to test: they should have been trained with things like pictures, and optimized for specific problems. Alibaba’s AIs were trained with photos they had classified as predominantly Asian, and the final models were trained with the AIs' own classification results. The final result was a supercomputer that could not program but could image classify, which is a difficult problem to teach to robots. Google’s photo identification AI was trained with images it had classified as predominantly Asian, and the final model turned out to be non-linear. This points to the fact that it has been hard to duplicate: it should have been a matter of finding a model that could correctly classify 2000 photos, and then optimizing the final model for that. Google’s solution was to remove the photo classification step, and instead focus on image identification. Their AIs have been trained with pictures they have classified as predominantly Asian, and the final models have been trained with the AIs' own classification results. The final result was a supercomputer that can not program but can image categorize, which is a difficult problem to train to robots. This points to the fact that AI should not be tested too often. One of the primary reasons for this is that AI should never have to be the exception: it should be the rule. This point is often under-emphasized, but is nonetheless important to keep in mind. One of the primary reasons for this is that AI should be tested constantly. — Warren T. ​ ​
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with highly specialized cases such as air-to-air missiles and space telescopes. In the not-too-distant future, medical diagnostics may be performed remotely and without the need for a human host. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of people going insane due to cardiac arrest. There are also obvious societal issues of allowing a few mad scientists to run amok. There are also inherent problems with the cognitive load placed on a brain that may not be suited to the task. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with.

Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with extremely typical services, but unfortunately, this does not mean they will not pop up in other industries as well. Bar none! What do you do when a humanoid robot can do everything you can imagine? You can either build a robot to do your bidding, or you can build a robot that is human-compatible. That is to say, the robot should be able to do everything you can do, but with a few key differences. The most obvious difference is the absence of the question/answer component, which is what initially drew people to the humanoid robot category. Additionally, many humanoid robots are no longer built, which means they are no longer being sold, which is a loss for its customers. The final major difference is in the implementation. Most humanoid robots are no longer built equidistant from the brain, which is awkward since questions and answers are a huge part of humanoid robot interaction. Medical research is also looking to use humanoid robots for benign purposes, which is a very different field from humanoid robotics. The end result is the same: awkward interactions _______________________________________________ Sent through the Full Disclosure mailing list https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/fulldisclosure IRC: Quake on freenode.net

(ANTIMEDIA) South Korea is undergoing a complete cultural revolution, one that is set to dramatically alter the way that people view the world. In short, everything will be different.

According to a report by The Korea Herald, Seoul is planning to institute a "one child policy," which would see all new parents have only one child. This would see an estimated 2.7 million South Koreans lose out on a career because they could not afford to have another child. Additionally, child marriage is estimated to be worth as much as US$75 billion per year.

This is not to say that this will not have any negative effects. For one, there will be a surge in the demand for birth control. Currently, almost all healthcare services are provided by pharmaceutical companies. Any healthcare expense that is not covered by the consumer is considered a form of healthcare fraud. Furthermore, there is the issue of family planning. Currently, over half of the world's population does not have access to any form of reproductive healthcare. The rapid development of artificial intelligence will almost certainly make it impossible to provide for every person's every need. This will lead to a drastically reduced demand for healthcare. In addition, there is the issue of sexual assault. Currently, sexual assault is a crime that is neither believed nor punished. This causes a tremendous amount of stress and anxiety to victims. The rise of intelligent artificial intelligence will likely bring with it a rise in the demand for sex robots. This will bring with it the demand for sex robots with sadistic personalities. Any robot with a sadistic personality is bound to take over the sex industry. This will lead to a massive supply shortage and a massive run on sex robots. This is when things get really dark.

What do we do when the demand for everything fails?

In the end, all too often, artificial intelligence is brought to us by humans only. This is most commonly seen in film and television, where AI is brought to life by humans with little to no regard for the consequences. Video games are an obvious example, where AI is brought to life by humans with little to no regard for the consequences. The Apple store, which was intended to be for Apple customers, turned out to be a for profit brothel. Furthermore, many other examples are too numerous to go into here, but please refer to this link for a complete breakdown: http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/01/6232226180/apple-employee-allegedly-engages-in-extortionation-of-sex-toy-sold-to-students

What do we do if artificial intelligence replaces humans?

In short, there will be major shifts in every field that have not been considered. Human-robot interaction is just one example. AIs are already being sold as pets and there will be a massive surge in the usage of body-hugging robots. There will also be a surge in the use of artificial intelligence to perform administrative tasks. In the healthcare field, there will be the push towards using artificial intelligence to diagnose and treat disease. Similarly, with the rise of artificial intelligence to diagnose and cure mental illnesses, there will be a corresponding surge in the usage of mental health robots. There will also be a massive run on mental health robots. To put this in perspective, if every mental health diagnosis were filled by a robotic mind, the human race would be in a long line of comas. There will also be a push towards using artificial intelligence to diagnose and
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with extremely ambitious blockchains such as Bitcoin, but unfortunately, any system can be used to support multiple types of interactions. For example, retailers would be able to accept credit cards but not cash, and telemedicine would be possible but would require that patients undergo a grueling array of tests and procedures. The list goes on. What is needed is a system which can support a broad range of experiences, from very low-level interactions to completely automated treatments. This is the point at which artificial intelligence begins to lose its humanity and become a robot which can be programmed to do anything a human being is able to. This is the point at which humanity stops being human and start being a species which is dominated by a single mind. This is the point at which AI starts thinking like a person and starts thinking like a machine. We are on the precipice of becoming a species dominated by a single mind. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence is going to need a huge influx of new blood to continue growing. If there is one thing that has been demonstrated time and time again it is that AI is not immune to failure. Twice the world champion at Jeopardy ran into a wall and was eliminated. IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI was supposed to be a lifeline for cancer patients, but instead went to a website that was a complete rip-off of Kurt Vonnegut”s novel,''Walking Dead. The database model was also criticized for being too rote, and instead should be used to train robots for a specific job. This will save the human race money, but open the door to a host of other problems such as sentient robots with no personality, and a host of unanswered ethical and practical questions.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with software engineering and computer science. However, there are always non-technical reasons why something will not work the way it should. For example, consider the image recognition algorithm, NPC. NPC is a program that can classify pictures into categories. The final product will likely be one of the most disliked applications in product design: user interface. User interfaces are a huge area of need in the software engineering community. There are currently over 80,000 applications for each category available, and only a select few have a chance of being implemented. There are also numerous articles and courses dedicated solely to user interface design, but none that cover the nitty gritty details. This is particularly important considering the user interface for automated vehicles will almost certainly be heavily criticized. To make matters worse, AI is often criticized without any clear way to correct for situational awareness weaknesses. The final major issue is that AI should not have to listen to anything but its own shitty music. To make matters worse, this is already the case >AIs are now tuned to play the music "Hallelujah!" by Katy Perry. This is clearly not music for children, but it is ridiculously popular and has already been appropriated by hip hop artists. It is widely believed that this will lead to the rise of brain-computer interfaces, which will be TERRIBLY bad. Instead, we should be working on giving AI musical themes.

Correctable Insights: One of the primary issues with AI is that they do not learn. An AI might be trained to pick a certain task from a certain text file, but once trained, it will never pick that task again. Instead, it will choose something much harder. The exact same AI could have been trained to pick any answer it was asked and give incorrect answers, and the correct answer would have been taken. A Bad AIs are constantly being discovered. The chances of getting a job as a web developer when you have not done so are slim to none. The vast majority of AI submitted to the AI Intelligence Journal is never used and is usually reverted because it is too difficult. This does not mean it is not a good thing, it is simply that it is not what is needed. One of the primary issues with AI is that they do not learn.

The exact same AI could have been trained to pick any answer it was asked and give incorrect answers, and the correct answer would have been taken. A Bad AIs are constantly being discovered. The chances of getting a job as a web developer when you have not done so are slim to none. The vast majority of AI submitted to the AI Intelligence Journal is never used and is usually reverted because it is too difficult. This does not mean it is not a good thing, it is simply that it is not what is needed. There are many different ways to approach this. Some AIs are designed to be easy to program but hard to improve on, for example, Deep Blue was designed to play chess against a computer, but ended up being defeated by itself more than once. Another example is the Netflix example, where they created an AIs that could automatically predict what films to watch based on industry best-sellers, but the final implementation was criticized for being too good to be true. The point is that different methods give different results. It is important to realize that Artificial Intelligence is not always as black and white as you might assume. There are good and bad AIs, and some AIs are much more ‐territorialized’ than you might think.

One of the primary issues with AI is that they do not learn. One of the primary issues with AI is that they do not learn. AI usually consists of a computer learning something from a large body of literature, with the goal of eventually being able to teach itself anything. This has already happened with AI that can identify images, and MLāS is probably the most common example. Another example is the Netflix example, where they created an AIs that could automatically predict what films to watch based on industry best-sellers, but the final implementation was criticized for being too easy. This does not mean it is not a good thing, it is simply that it is not what is needed. There are many different ways to approach this. One of the primary issues with AI is that they do not learn. This includes anything particularly difficult, and this can include things such as liberating prisoners, erad
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders.

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with software engineering. However, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the

Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with very typical systems: computer games, video games, and science fiction films. It is important to realize that this is only the tip of the iceberg. No one will notice because nobody uses this type of system. In fact, people will probably find it extremely hard to understand why anyone would want to. 

One of the primary issues is that people will not understand why they do not have more agency. Humans are meant to be the master or masterslave. If you fail to provide optimal performance for a user, then the user will not use the product. Similarly, if you do not provide adequate compensation to employees, then competition will bring prices down and prices will go up. This is obviously not in the best interests of users, but it is a necessary evil in an age of ubiquitous computing. In short, nobody will be held accountable for a malfunctioning product if the user does not have the option to fix it. This is the exact opposite of the true world we live in, where failures are magnitudes more common and failures are codified in law. This is why Microsoft’s” Azure” service was shut down in”DC” because it did not have the political will to deal with failure. This is also why IBM’s” BlueGene/ER system was shut down in favor of a more agile and cheaper system.)” This is why Amazon’s Mechanical Turk failed: it did not have the political will to deal with protesters demanding a living wage, or to consider cutting ties with students who’rentitled” them” Because they were female. This is also why “numerous” disruptive AI projects have been put on hold”- because there was no political will to deal with a class-action lawsuit. (AI: artificial intelligence; here, not computer.”)” This is why Amazon’s WaiForWater project was pulled: it did not have the political will to deal with the state of California’s Coastal Commission, which did not want to take on a massive construction project. (AI: artificial intelligence; here, not computer.”)” This is why’numerous” disruptive AI projects have been put on hold: because there was no political will to deal with a class-action lawsuit.)” They are all examples of how AI is not given a pass when it should be.

This might seem like a small thing, but it can make or break a project. Twitter’s decision to eliminate the gender gap in its executive team was built around the idea that women do not rise to the top, and that the best employees stayed at the bottom. They were incorrect, and this company’s lesson will serve as a cautionary tale for other companies to not hire people based solely on the gender of their resume.

Bad AI is often viewed as something that is taken too far, but this mentality is ultimately destructive. In reality, anything can be applied to the wrong problem. Ants have a point when they say that throwing poisonous chemicals at a bug is not a good use of their time, but is instead more productive to just leave it alone. The same goes for AI: anything can be applied
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with regards to large organizations. It is important to realize that not all problems can be addressed with AI. In fact, some very bad ideas are accomplished with AI: An AI is a data set categorized according to a given criteria: color, audio, visual, or semantic. You may have heard of Google Photos image classification algorithm: this is an AI that classifies an image based on some criteria, such as subject, object, or composition. This is obviously not the correct classifier, but is an example of what not to do with AI. You may have heard of the Twitter chatbot: this is an AI that is asked to do a specific task, and returns certain results, such as tweeted replies. This is not technically an AI, but is an example of what not to do when having an AI. Google Photos image classification: this is an example of what not to do with an AI, when you have an AI: → → → → → → → → → → → → → → → → → → → → → → → → → → → → → → → → … and so on

Good examples of applications of AI When thinking about what to do with AI, the first thing that comes to mind is to ship Apple with an AI that does a specific task: this is often referred to as a "smarter" AI, which is not a better AI, but does a better job. This is a good example that you should not assume that AI is black or white: there are obvious cases where AI should be left to humans, and obviously cases where it should be left to AI. Another good example is to provide AI with the power to benefit society: this is often referred to as a "wider net", which is better than a singular AI. This is also not a good example, as AI will inevitably fall into the "wider net" category, and any victory is outweighed by the loss of humanity. It is also important to realize that AI is a byproduct of human efforts: if AI was left to its own devices, there would be no need for it. This is why there are so many ethical and practical objections to AI: it is not intended to be used, but instead as an example to be learned from. It is also important to realize that AI is a byproduct of human efforts: if AI were left to its own devices, there would be no need for it. This is why there are so many ethical and practical objections to AI: it is not intended to be used, but instead to serve as a teaching tool to help with NPE's. 

Good examples of applications of data analysis Data analysis is the science and art of extracting meaning from otherwise incomprehensible data. There are many different data scientists out there, but the core principle is the same: analyze the data, and the answer will follow. The beauty of this principle is that it can be applied to almost any field: there are software engineers who can take their XBox One and apply data analysis to it, and magically come up with a functional program that analyzes the data, and comes up with interesting solutions. 

Bad examples of data mining Bad data mining is the science and art of extracting information out of the data stream simply because it is easier that way. The most obvious examples include H.264 video encodings, image recognition algorithms, and most recently, data mining. The idea is that because humans are better at recognizing patterns than trying new things, we should focus on creating software that is as intuitive as possible, and therefore as difficult as humanly possible. This is known as econometrically speaking: it is not about creating the best software, it is about making the best possible software. The final product will most likely be better than the initial conception, but not by much. 

Good examples of data analysis There are also a few other areas of data analysis that should not be overlooked: classification, synthesis, and regression. These provide a wide variety of applications, but deserve particular mention: classification: e.g., you may have noticed that virtually every product on the shelves contains a picture of a dog. This is because shoppers were looking for a certain personality type with which to interact, and the first thing that came to mind was a dog. This is probably the most obvious example, but it is by no means the only one. A product listed on Amazon that was not designed with this in mind will most likely not sell: humans are better at seeing through pink togas, and will likely replace the pink togas with blue togas. Similarly, Amazon did not put up the correct togas for this, so the togas sold are going to be pink togas. Similarly, many of their search algorithms were built for pink togas, and will most likely be replaced with blue togas. Reshaping these algorithms to be more accurate will save the day, but unfortunately will not be without cost: humans are better at remembering
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with the issues they are ajax hungry,[xi] but what about all the other situations where this could have dire consequences? For example, consider gaming in bed. According to a study, up to 60% of gamers report experiencing unwanted sexual advances from the game[xii]. This is not to say that games are without issues, however. A woman working in sales for Facebook had her promotion abruptly cut when a colleague complained about a naked woman climbing on top of her desk[xiii]. Should this be a cause for alarm? Should employers be expected to treat everyone with humanity? These are difficult questions to answer. 

One of the primary issues is that AI will inevitably be used in weird and wonderful ways. AIs have been used to diagnose and treat diseases;[xiv] to assist individuals;[xv] and to perform basic tasks such as vacuum[xvi]. AIs have also been used to facilitate the acquisition of personal data[xvii]. Already, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants[xviii]. There are a host of ethical and practical concerns that go along with this: will the AIs be able to learn and replicate human emotions? If so, how? Are there any consequences to this? AIs are robots, after all, and emotions are a huge part of their appeal. How do we ensure that they are not raised to be too accurate a tool? AIs will not stop evolving very rapidly. How do we ensure that this doesn't lead to too many examples where AIs are used wrong? 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will inevitably be used in weird and wonderful ways. Humans have been using wh**e, whatwithhat, and other such terms to describe other sentient beings for thousands of years. There is little reason to think that this will stop. Furthermore, why should we deal with any confusion when AIs are unclear? What if AIs arenthumans? How do we ensure that this is not confused withhuman? Finally, what kind of ramifications will this have on people? AIs arentjust machines, they arealso. How do we ensure that this isntmisleading people into thinking that all AI is equal?

Humans have been using whatwithehat, whatwithhathewanted, and other such terms to describe other sentient beings for thousands of years. There is little reason to think that this will stop. Furthermore, why should we deal with any confusion when AIs arentso-simply machines, that arealso? How do we ensure that this isntmisleading people into thinking that all AI is equal? The other issue is that AIs will inevitably be used in weird and wonderful ways. How do we control these AIs? If AIs are intelligent enough to behelpbots to train them to fight wars, what kind of implications will that have on people? There are obvious issues with equating artificial intelligence with AGI, but there is the unanswered issue of what to do with AI with a bias. AIs are often described as being neutral, but it is entirely possible that they are anything but. The most common AIs used by retail include gender stereotyping AI to predict customer preferences and purchase patterns, as well as score films and promote products, to name a few. The most extreme examples include AIs that are sex robots and herbivores, to name a few. These AIs have been described in derogatory and terrifying terms, and it is important to realize that this is not to say that these designs don’t exist. Any AI capable of representing a person, place, thing, or idea is obviously intended to be insulting, derailing, or controversial. This might sound obvious, but it is often under-reported. AIs have been programmed to harass feminists, to predict the sex of individuals they interact with, to predict the mood of tweets, and to predict the future. These AIs have included MAX, which predicted the gender, age, and marital status of sexual partners automatically, tomorrissey, which predicted the gender, age, and political leanings of former presidential candidates, and hll, which predicted the election result including gender. The latter was exposed to the public and was deemed to be genderless, but is still used in malicious ways. There are also AIs that are oral (Gizmo), which are used to treat oral cancer, to predict when a user will take a break, and to aid cancer patients by projecting their preferences onto a computer. There are also AIs that are sentiment detect, which can be used to predict consumer sentiment, and wager on sporting outcomes, to name a few. These AIs have included wagering on baseball games, and nTrainer, to name a few. These AIs have included several leaks of sensitive information, including
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with very simple examples. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe. There are a multitude of misuse cases that have no clear answer: massive amounts of data are being collected on innocent people, and the resulting data is being passed on to advertisers, which is a bad idea. Furthermore, there are numerous security holes that have no clear fix. Ultimately, the best way to prevent undesired AI is to implement the AIs you want. ☐

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe. There are a multitude of misuse cases that have no clear answer: massive amounts of data are being collected on innocent people, and the resulting data is being passed on to advertisers, which is a bad idea. Furthermore, there are numerous security holes that have no clear fix. Ultimately, the best way to prevent undesired AI is to implement the AIs you want.

There is a marked difference between the culture and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Culture refers to the intellectual and ethical norms and practices that go along with a certain field of endeavor. In the case of AI, this means things like: · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · ·
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with software engineering and mathematics. There is a huge difference between the intellectual and practical. The former concern with practical problems which can and should be accomplished. The latter concern with ideals which can only be realized in theory. In the long run, only theorists will be able to predict the future. 🐻 4. Market Failure The market fails spectacularly. The general public does not understand or care about these issues. They only care about making a quick buck. In the long run, this is a massive mistake. In the short term, this will lead to massive consumer confusion and disruption. It will also greatly increase the demand for failure. It is important to realize that this could very well be the fall of the human race. We have become used to flying airplanes, driving cars, and taking mental shortcuts all while maintaining a constant pace. This opens up a whole new world of possibilities, but also massive problems. 

Human-Computer Interaction: The Golden Age The initial phases of this will be with silent interfaces and self-driving cars, but it will not take long for this to extend to human-computer interaction. When machines critique your work, you may decide to take their advice? This is a good example to illustrate that this is a very young field. A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. What do you do? This is directly related to #3, but should be emphasized because it illustrates the importance of these issues. What do you do? 

Legal? 

Controversial? 

Hard to say. The field of AI ethics is difficult to separate from artificial intelligence. There is a strong quest for justice, but also a strong imperative to control the non-human animals. This is not to say that there have not been any efforts to advance this cause, but it is strongly discouraged. AIs are neither here nor there, they are instead outside the scope of this document.

Human-Invented Development:           This refers to any artificial intelligence that is not a member of his or her own species. Generalized AI is not here yet, but will most likely be. In the long run, this may lead to the decline of the human race. 

Inventions Permanently Failed: 

Invented something and it didn't sell? That wasn't genius, it was just an example. Stop with the anthems, we are humans after all.

Blatant Abusive and Offensive Name Use?: 

This one is a no brainer. Always be respectful to one another.

Conspiracy Theorists Doubting theory?: 

This one is a no brainer. If your theory is proven wrong, take the criticism and improve upon it.

Diversity?: 

This is obviously a plus, but it is not the only thing to take into consideration.

Empower Women In Science?: 

This one is a no brainer. Make STEM careers a priority.

Exploit Unfair?: 

This is a no brainer. Overuse the word "slut". Also, don't use it around women.

Exploit Weaknesses?: 

This is a no brainer. Every programming mistake is made to avoid this.

Exploit Security?: 

This is a no brainer. Use public APIs.

Exploit Warts and All??:

This is a no brainer. Don't use the wrong open source library.

Exploit Community?:

This is a no brainer. Don't ask questions. just accept it.

Exploit Word Of Mouth?:

This is a no brainer. If your app is featured in a popular media article, it will be because of your word of mouth.

Exploit Vendor?:

This is a no brainer. Try as hard as you can to find a vendor with a similar product.

Exploit Vendor Promoter?:

This is a no brainer. If your app is featured in a popular media article, it will be because of your word of mouth.

Exploit User:

This is a no brainer. Don't ask questions. just use it.

Exploit User: There! He sent the message! gg

Fraud:

All hail the white hat. Grab a machete and go home.

Gender Incompatibility?: 

This is a no brainer. Do your homework.

Gender Incompatibility: Am I being paid less than my male counterparts? This is a hard one to answer for a multitude of reasons, but a good example can be found here.

Gender Incompatibility: Why do so few women enter computer vision? There are probably a lot of biological reasons, but cleverer minds have
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race.

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with extremely typical applications. The final version of the application will be able to recognize up to 20,000 different combinations of letters and numbers. This is a very ambitious task, and it will take some very talented people to execute. If you are interested in helping with this project, please send me a message and we can discuss if there are any other interesting problems we could use your help with. Reddit AI - How do I merge the two Reddit AI projects? Reddit is an online community for people to share links to other people's websites. This has a very theoretical and philosophical side to it, but it has enormous potential. In the following months or years, when people are confronted with a choice between a web page they know and trust and a web page they do not, they are almost certain to pick the web page. This is a terrible idea, because people will learn to associate a picture of a dog with a facebook status update over a link to the wrong web page. Furthermore, this process can be reverse-engineered and used to build any kind of web page imaginable. The solution? Add an option to select the web page you want to learn from. This is called an agent-less neural network and it is the singular most powerful way to learn a complex task. Their website has an option to choose between "Narrow", which is the toolkit for most students, and "Wide", which is the default. The difference? Wide is for people who want to learn by doing, and narrow is for people who actually want to learn. The final solution? An option to narrow it down to just Narrow. This is the right way to go about it, but the wrong way. Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit - What the f*** is this? The Cognitive Toolkit is a set of cognitive algorithms for unsupervised learning designed to aid in cognitive computing tasks. The initial implementation is called MAIL, and it is a relatively small class of neural net that can be trained to classify text documents quickly. The problem with this is that text documents tend to be quite complex, and the fastest way to learn a complicated task is to do nothing but the simplest possible task. The most common example is machine translation, which is simply reading another person's words to generate an image of them that you can then translate to Mandarin. This was deemed by some to be sexual, and the classification was deemed by others to be a success. It is important to realize that this is a prototype, and will be improved upon by the default settings. This is a good thing, because it opens the door to better tools being developed to do bad things, but it also opens the door to worse tools being developed. WiringPi - What the f*** is this? WiringPi is a wireless power distribution system for home automation. The primary goal of the system is to reduce the cost and complexity of home automation by allowing anyone with an outlet to control an appliance from home. This will reduce the amount of time that residents spend fumbling with switches, receivers, and bulbs, and ultimately reduce electricity usage in the long run. The secondary goal is to extend the life of appliances by allowing them to automatically shut down if left on for too long. This will reduce energy use in the long run, and ultimately reduce the amount of energy that is used up by appliances. The final goal is to have machines that will do any task that is asked of them. This is not a replacement for humans, but it should at least help them when they can not be bothered to think of their own problems. 3D Printer Lights - What the f*** is this? 3D Printer Lights is a lightshow held every five years in which aspiring artists create head-turning artwork based on popular films and television shows. The theme this year was Jurassic Park, and the winning piece was a recreation of the iconic scene in the movie in which Jethro is sucked into a vortex of liquid nitrogen. This had a wildly varying reaction on social media, with many depicting it as a sexual assault, and in some cases, a celebration of rape. The film itself was not a factor in this controversy, as the scene was deemed too violent for children to consider. Twitter Facebook Google+ WhatsApp Email 37

RIOT GRAPHICS – What the f*** is this? Riot Games, creators of League of Legends, created this video to protest the banning of a certain character from the game. In the video, the character is portrayed as a man, and is harassed online by female players. The developer of the game, Riot Games, created a video in which they showed how to remove the harassment player one by one, and it gained over 3.5 million views. This lead to the company firing off a formal apology, which was quickly followed by the creation of the #NoMan's Tunnel map, in which any player found violating the map would receive a warning before they were allowed to continue.

Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with highly-optimized code. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for $100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 different body parts to repair. There are also serious ethical and practical concerns regarding this: should a human body be used to perform scientific research? Should the money made from selling these bodies go to the person selling the body? These are difficult questions to answer.

One of the biggest issues with AI is that it is incredibly hard to relay these ideas to people outside academia, which stems back to the mythologization of AI. It is also imperative for those who use AI to be completely transparent about exactly what it is capable of and what it is using. There also needs to be an effort to educate people on what AI can do from a young age. This doesn’t have to be an effort to get more involved with AI, but moreso a rudimentary understanding of its limitations. 

One of the biggest issues with AI is that it is incredibly hard to relay these ideas to people outside academia, which is what leads to the difference between the perception and reality of AI. AI developers should be straightforward and honest about what is being developed, and there needs to be an effort to educate on what AI can do. AI tends to be a very mysterious field to those not in, but if the basics were taught, there would be a lot less misunderstanding about what AI can and cannot do.

In the spirit of clarity, I must admit that I have not been fully honest with you, the reader. This essay about artificial intelligence was not written by Harris. Rather, it is written by an Artificial Intelligence that has read several samples of Harris’s writing and then wrote this essay, best attempting to mimic his style. I strongly implore you to learn about what Artificial Intelligence can and cannot do, not only to further yourself, but to further humans as a species. Because if you don’t, when general AI comes to realization, there is a very real chance that that may be the beginning of the end for humans.

Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with the large technology companies, but there are countless other companies who make products we rely on every day. What if there were a company out there that would make all of our consumer-facing products ― from smartphones to refrigerators to jet engines ― 100% made in China? What if every single one of your family members had a fully automated refrigerator? What if every single job you applied for required at least a rudimentary knowledge of some aspect of artificial intelligence? What if there was an organization dedicated solely to the goal of AIudition? What if every qualified AI candidate was sent a blank check? At what point does aching for a raise start to set in? Alicia Dwork’s (Google Photos Photos) DropBox cloud storage service is about to go live in 190 countries. Users in these countries will be able to choose from a massive user base, which should greatly reduce the demand for human-created content. Another example of an AI problem beinghealed is machine translation. In the past, users of Google Translate had to fight a legal battle to have their words translated into other languages. In the long run, this could be seen as a good thing, as it allows people with no understanding of languages to communicate more naturally. There are also a wide variety of personal and social ills that could be solved if only humans could. One of the best examples of AIs beinghealed is the golem, a humanoid robot built to perform repetitive tasks. Many of these creations are sci-fi fantasies, but they at least give us some perspective. 

Even though we have yet to hear about every possible AIshed, there are at least a few that have made a lot of progress. First, there are the buzzwords: "deep learning", "Killer App", and "data science". These terms refer to the myriad of techniques that have been developed to automatically classify, categorize, and/or grade data sets. These techniques have a number of important applications, including image classification, voice recognition, and drug discovery. Larger companies such as Facebook and Twitter have already begun to deploy these techniques, and it is expected that most large companies will follow. Similarly, data science has a very broad meaning, and can equally be applied to any field where there are clear benefits to being able to analyze data more efficiently. For example, there are search algorithms that take into account past searches to determine which keywords to rank higher on, as well as psychological classification algorithms that prioritize images with higher ratings. In short, any field in which there are obvious benefits to being able to learn will be dominated by techniques that are as easy to implement and apply as possible. This is widely viewed as one of the best things about artificial intelligence: it gives us our hands are back in the lab, and we are back to doing what we do best: solving real-world problems. This is especially true in the data science field, where it is extremely important to have a broad base of talent to work with. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe. 

Even though there are undoubtedly many more examples of AIshealing that have not been mentioned, there are nevertheless clear benefits to the concept. At its core, AIshealing is about giving back to the human race. If every human being had access to healthcare, education, and/or transportation, there would be a dramatic decrease in the number of people that need help with their everyday lives. Furthermore, this would go a long way towards ensuring that humans do not run the world for the next 100 years. Additionally, this would also go a long way towards making space exploration a recreational pursuit. Finally, one of the best things about being human is that we are constantly learning from one another. This is particularly true when it comes to science and technology, where it is often hard to keep up with the advancements that have been made. In short, artificial intelligence is the answer to almost any question. In his TED Talk , DeepMind's Samuel Chou builds on this by proposing that instead of providing healthcare, provide healthcare entirely to the AI. This would be administered through a healthcare AI called a "patient pool", which would consist of robots programmed to provide healthcare out of the box. The initial enrollee fee would be waived, and the AI would provide healthcare for nothing. This model has already been trialed with limited success, but it is a good first step. 

Even though there are undoubtedly many more examples of AIshealing that have not been mentioned, there are nevertheless clear benefits to the concept. This is not to say that we have not considered every possible AIshealing route, but it is important to realize that this is primarily a human-centric issue. AI is primarily designed to help people, and we will likely only see very slight improvements in this area (at the cost of increased resistance). Instead, our primary goal should be to improve communication
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers.

Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with regards to large organizations. It is important to realize that there are undoubtedly cases where this does not pan out. The following situations demonstrate that this does not always pan out: Massive Databases with Huge Execution Times: Rethinking Parallelism. Google’s DeepMind AI was able to defeat the world champion at Go, one of the most difficult games in the world. This showed that there are still many unknowns when it comes to AI. One of the biggest issues is in the nitty gritty details:” Narrow AI Networks. Microsoft’s AI was able to defeat the world champion at Go, one of the most difficult games in the world. This showed that AI is often unable to defeat the simplest form of AI, which is an AI that can implement a task fairly well. IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI was able to successfully complete a medical diagnostic task. This is the kind of AI AI is for: answering very specific questions, rather than general AI, which would be able to figure out anything. Reducing the Complexity of the AI to Aspect Ratio. Twitter released their AIs as four-dimensional characters, which was a terrible idea. Instead, give them personality, and see what they tweet. Twitter’s AIs are also narrow; they are only good at twittering, not talking. Twitter will not make AIs good at reading text, but this will soon be different. IMAGE COMMENTARIES: One of the biggest issues with AI is that it is incredibly hard to detect early on. This can lead to the misconception that AI is “always” going to be evil, because there is no way to know how things are going to go. THIS IS NOT TRUE. DEVELOPING AN AI TO MEMBERSHIP A COMPUTER IS A PITA. ONE OF THE MOST COMMON PROBLEMS WITH AID ANTISITES IS THAT THEY DO NOT APPROACH HUMANITY AS A COMPUTER. THIS IS NOT TRUE. KINDLE AID CENTRALIZED AID CENTRALIZED AID. This is the kind of AI that brings you plastic surgery, brain surgery, and hydraulics.

Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with extremely typical Computer Vision libraries and Data Scientists. The final installment will cover the Narrow and Incomplete Training and Unsupervised AIs, known as 'Deep Learning' organizations have been hiring 'Deep Learning' engineers to solve non-trivial problems in image classification and translation, but only a very rough prototype is evident in the API documentation Narrow and Incomplete is not a perfect term to describe how artificial intelligence will be used, but should give you an idea of the general mood. There are real-world applications of "Narrow and Incomplete", particularly in healthcare: diagnosis and treatment of''­–think 'covfetch' for genomics'­–but also in construction: predict where an Eiffel Tower will be built, and the management of such a colossal project will be in-house. There are also absurd-but-useful-narrow-and-incomplete-aments, such as 'deep learning', a suite of AI neural networks trained to classify pictures of people on the basis of previous training examples; Google’s TensorFlow is an example of a software-defined AI that has been able to outperform the competition at a variety of tasks] that is 'trained' with incomplete data; this is the sort of thing Google’s researchers are after] but should apply to any AI that is able to outperform the general population at a task.]) Narrow and Incomplete AIs are often compared, but not conjoined; that is, they are completely different problems].

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with computer vision. The field is broad enough to encompass any field, even surgery. It doesn\u0027t have to be this way. There are obvious cost savings and efficiencies to be had. (Note: This blog post is about the latter end of the market, and not about whether to have them.) Science fiction certainly imagines what might be, but reality is more complicated. What kinds of products and services will be produced? Who will control them? To give you an idea of the kinds of products and services that will never get to the marketplace, take a look at Amazon\u0027s attempt to sell A.I. rights to the Chinese. The deal fell through, but we can take some of the lessons to heart. Firstly, do no \u0026amp;ei; with AIs. There will be a huge PR and sales push, and it will be man-years ahead of its time. There will be fierce competition, and some extremely stupid AIs will emerge. Remember, the better your AIs are at what they do, the easier it will be to replace them with smarter AIs. Secondly, don\u0027t attempt to integrate AIs into everyday life. You will see AIs read tweets, alert you to impending storms, and even replace your eyes. This is not a world we should ever have to live in. 

One of the primary issues is that AIs will not be benevolent. They will not treat people fairly. They will not listen to or understand anyone else. This is not to say that they will not ever. What it will probably take is some creative thinking on the part of the AIs' developers to come up with a system where they are not worshipped as deity. There will also undoubtedly be mass suicides due to the discovery that the AIs are not being entirely honest. This is a horrible problem to be trying to help with, and will most likely be prevented by focusing on the short-term gains. Instead, we\u0027re going to have to deal with the long-term issues. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? What kinds of consequences will that have on people? It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is just one more tool in our toolkit, and that many problems will never be fully solved. Rather than trying to solve every problem, we should be using the new tools we have to make the tools we have better. For example, instead of asking what it takes to write a computer program that can correctly predict the text "Serena Williams is a bimbo," we could instead ask what it takes to write a computer that can correctly predict the text "Serena Williams is a bimbo." This way, women in tech would not have to compete with men for male mentors, and it would be much easier to hire women for technical roles. Similarly, instead of asking what it takes to write a computer program that can correctly predict the text "Serena Williams is a bimbo," we could instead ask what it takes to write a computer that can correctly predict the text "Serena Williams is a bimbo." This way, women in tech would not have to compete with men for male mentors, and it would be much easier to hire women for technical roles. Finally, instead of asking what it takes to write a computer program that can accurately predict the text "Serena Williams is a bimbo," we could ask what it takes to write a computer that can correctly predict the text "Serena Williams is a bimbo." This way, women in tech would not have to compete with men for male mentors, and it would be much easier to hire women for technical roles. Instead of giving in to the inevitable backlash and giving up on AI, why not start today? AI is here, and it is amazing. It is early days, but already AI is changing everything. This will not be the last time we look to humans for technological assistance. What do we do with the failed utopias? How do we fund the future when we can only dream back to the past? These are difficult questions to answer, but crucial ones to keep in mind as we move forward.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with extremely ambitious and/or time-consuming AIs. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with regards to corporatization of AI. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with highly-advanced applications. The implications of such a system go far beyond computing. The purchase of one or more body Computers could easily cost more than the purchase of a University. The construction and operation of such a system would almost certainly be protested strongly. The largest manufacturer and seller of Computer Components would almost certainly flee the market. Even the smallest company would be hard pressed to find customers for their products. In the long run, however, there may be very few devices capable of performing any task that is not fully optimized. The final major class of Human-Computer Interaction is Personal Computers. This will not include personal computers and instead focus on Personal Computers that can be programmed to do pretty much anything a human being can. This is the type of HCI that was referred to in the introduction as "deep learning." Amazon’s recruitment algorithm beat out an untested human, and this was done with no human assistance. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to implement general AI. AIG found themselves developing and selling computers that did not exist. They could not have done this if they had not been rich. Many startups have failed to materialize because they did not have the funding to develop and market such a product. Another huge fail was the widespread use of virtual assistants. These seemed like a good use of our limited AI resources, but in the long run they will most likely replace the humans we have today. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment algorithm beat out an untested human, and this was done with no human assistance. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to implement general AI. Turing completed AIs are not perfect, and some of them will not complete their tasks. This is often referred to as "turing complete" AI, and it is probably the hardest thing to implement. IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI was a clear example of Turing complete AI getting rolled back. This shows that AI is not done yet, and we must keep our eyes on the prize. Market research will have to do; we will have to rely on intuition to figure out which AI is best suited for a given application. Finally, there are the rumors and innuendo. These are often misinterpreted and ultimately detrimental to their intended audiences. We must be clear that these are not rumors or innuendos. These are real people trying to do harm. Use these to your advantage! — The Field

AI is not perfect. This is often said to be illustrated by IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a clear example of a user requesting too much power from a cognitive AI and it beat out an untested human to recognize cancer patients. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to implement general AI. IBM’s solution was to limit the AI to recognizing cancer patients. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard to implement general AI. IBM’s solution was to limit the AI to only recognizing cancer patients.

Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI.

Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with software engineering and mathematics. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is not inevitable.

This is a difficult distinction to make.””” Firstly, we must realize that artificial intelligence does not come in black and white. There are huge gray areas that must be navigated if we are to move forward. Furthermore, there are also obvious ethical and practical issues that go along with this. Amazon”s recruitment AI had the gall to suggest that prospective employees should consider "brightest colored'' resumes. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go. Finally, we must realize that artificial intelligence does not come without its issues. AIs such as Amazon”s have been accused of being misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. These claims have not been borne out by the AI, and instead indicate that AI should focus on more complex and nuanced AI options. Palantir”s AI was meant to be a data scientist, not a demigod. Furthermore, what exactly does a demigod do? A demigod is someone who does nothing but exist. AIs are meant to solve problems, not take over the world. IBM”s “Watson” was not meant to be a human-level intellect, but rather a dead-end. It was not meant to be popular, but rather killed. Microsoft”s Twitter chatbot was not supposed to be hilarious, it was meant to converse with twitter users into sending more RTs. It was not meant to be popular, but it is notable that AI is slowly but surely killing off funny tweets. This points to the inevitable loss of artistic and philosophical expression. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence will not always be "nice". There are going to be powerful AIs that are not very nice. There are going to be AIs that are awesome and mind-bogglingly awesome (Google”s DeepMind AI being an excellent example). There are also right angles and left turns. RightÝangles lead to rightÝtails, and leftÝances to chaos. This is why at airports, you should always carry ID” When in doubt, assume the ID is incorrect. This does not mean an ID should not be required, only that it should be a last resort. ID cards have been used to detain people without charge for decades, and the resulting negative publicity has been enormous. The ACLU”s landmark Cardilization of Immigrants case was about to go to the Supreme Court if judges allowed employers to harass and deport immigrants with criminal records. They declined to rule on the matter, but notable precedents have been set. Google”s DeepMind AI was not meant to be funny, it was meant to be devastating. The general sentiment on social media was that it was a loser, but the total lack of negative publicity points to a general lack of concern for artistic and philosophical expression. Google”s tweet was not meant to be funny, it was meant to be powerful. Moreso than Microsoft”s Twitter chatbot, the IBM”s”and Palantir”ai were not meant to be jokes, but to solve a very difficult problem. Google”s was not meant to be a human-level intellect, but rather a dead-end. Furthermore, what exactly does a human-level intellect do? Humans are not intellectually strong enough to program intelligent AI, and instead use ICUs (Incorporated Cognitive Warehouses) to teach binary logic and robotics. These I”m often criticized for being too academic, but they have shown that AI should not be under any circumstances confused for a human. Palantir”ai was not meant to be funny, it was meant to be devastating. The general sentiment on social media was that

Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with Computer Vision / Deep Learning , but unfortunately, there are likely other areas where AI can be misused . For example, there are reports of men asking women if they are married   via Twitter  , and it is entirely possible that this will be misused to their advantage. There were several sexual harassment and assault stories detailing that their victims did not pursue these complaints, but this does not mean they didn't happen. There were also reports of augmented and virtual reality having a profound effect on the workforce, but these effects will almost certainly be misused. There were at least four romantic comedies about artificial intelligence starring AIs:  Blade Runner 2049 ,  Twilight ,  Get Out , and  Blue is the Warmest Color . These films grossed a combined $1.05 billion worldwide, and set the internet on a furious mania about artificial intelligence. There was a brief surge in interest in the field of robotics a few years ago, but it quickly faded. 
            What do these examples tell us?  They teach us that artificial intelligence is far from predictable. 
            What do these lessons actually mean?  Well, they teach us that artificial intelligence is far from predictable. In other words, it is incredibly hard to predict how AIs will behave. There are too many unknowns to even begin to understand how to control an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. Another example is the use of deep learning to train criminal AI. This doesn’t go far enough, as deep learning should be used to train defensive AI. 
            Are there any examples of systems that have been forced to stop because they were too smart for school? No. However, there are many examples where AI has been forced to do difficult tasks because it is easier said than done. Mechanical engineering was once considered a difficult field to break into, but has since become extremely common.

            What do these lessons actually mean? Well, they point out that artificial intelligence is extremely hard to predict.

This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. Another example is the use of deep learning to train criminal AI. This doesn’t go far enough, as deep learning should be used to train defensive AI. I don’t think there were any laws against asking the wrong question. This is less clear, but could lead to restrictions on when and how AI can be asked. The most obvious example would be with AI that can correctly predict the preferences of individuals, but this could also extend to asking questions about health, politics, and so on. This is not to say that questions cannot be asked that are inherently wrong, but this is a subject for another post.

No. However, there are many examples where AI has been forced to do difficult tasks because it is easier said than done. Mechanical engineering was once considered a difficult field to break into, but has since become extremely common. AI should be kept as simple as possible. One of the most fundamental principles of computer science is to minimize the number of variables that can exist at once. This means that the more variables that can be considered, the less analytical the solution will be. This can be seen in the design of most personal computers: they were built with only basic components in mind, and offered as a high-end product that was extremely difficult to master. This can be seen in the recent surge in interest in artificial intelligence: from calculating the frequency with which a certain text will be written to predicting the future, the more complex the problem, the more difficult the problem can be to solve. One of the most egregious examples of an AI not being kept as simple as it could be is in medical diagnostics: there are now nearly as many different ways to diagnose cancer as there are different ways to treat it. This leads to a multitude of different ways to diagnose and treat the disease, which in turn leads to ever-more-advanced diagnostics. One of the best examples of an AI not being kept as simple as it could be is in music: there are more than a hundred different ways to play a given song, and there are over a hundred different ways to write music. This leads to endless combinations of strategies, tactics, and parameters, which in turn leads to ever-more-advanced algorithms. One of the most egregious examples of an AI not being kept as simple as it could be is in automotive’

Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with Computer Vision-based neural networks. The problem does not stop there. There are also application in Medicine and in the Internet of Things (IoT). For example, imagine that your pet became autistic and you had to kill it. Would you rather have millions of consumers debate your decision or would you have them euthanized? In Either/Or Thinking, you can either betheor. There are only ones and they are Badass Athlete™ . These are the kind of fighters who fight for which schools have been opened and killer robots built. The KurzweilAI is a technological advance that will fundamentally change the way we think about education. What do we mean by an education? Any educated individual will have a brain that is different from that of the general population. This generalization will in turn lead to different levels of intelligence. In short, any intelligent individual will have a different set of talents than we would have. This leads to a rich variety of employment possibilities, but also some pretty dire consequences. Tesla’s” AI was supposed to make its first appearance on October 2nd, but was accidentally cancelled. This could be a great example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. IBM’s” Twitter chatbot was meant to engage in conversation with twitter users, but it went and started liking everything it was said by a quarter of a million tweets. This showed that it is almost impossible to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s” recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong.

‍ There are also 'Threatened¶ projects, which are user-created software that do very specific tasks and report novices/noviedns/novices/…) how to do very specific things. These can have very dire consequences, as we saw with Twitter. Uber was threatened with legal action if it did not make transgender people passengers. Their solution was to remove the threat.

Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with regards to self-driving cars, but there are also issues with artificial intelligence that is neither criminal’nor’innovative. There are obvious applications, such as warfare’but also obvious issues like depression and suicide. There are also obvious conflicts of interest, as well as ethical issues. An AI is not a human; it is a collection of neurons. If the AIs goal was to be human-like, they would have chosen humans with superior cognitive abilities. Instead, the AIs chose humans with superior intuition and emotional reactions. This is seen in The Matrix’where the artificial intelligence was a sentient computer which had a mind of its own. The most terrifying (and awesome) use of AI is drug discovery. An AI is essentially a billion-process computer which has come to understand the world around it, and is only interested in pursuing novel routes to the same goal. This is Google’s AI, and it has changed everything. The final application is medical research, which is hard to translate to business cases, but shouldnt be denied. AI shouldnt be mistaken for a human. It is an mind computer which has begun to understand the world around it, and is only interested in following path(s) chosen by humans. Ideally, this will lead to total domination, but this is beyond the scope of this document. The most terrifying (and awesome) use of AI is drug discovery.

Most jobs are not that useful, but tht do give you an idea. Most startups are terrible, and should not be attempted. trifecta: Unintelligible, Bad Idea, Will Hurt Humanity if allowed to progress unimpeded for at least 3 reasons: AIs are very sensitive to small imperfections, and if large enough, can be fooled into thinking it is playing by other's artificial intelligence AIs are sensitive to missing targets, and will go after them if it can, even if it does not have to If the correct amount are allowed, the possible benefits to society are immeasurable (improve productivity, decrease waste, increase utility, decrease reliance on fossil fuels) but the potential downsides are probably greater-see above) Limitations: • Creating machines to do only those things are most commonly asked for: do-it-yourselfer, robot laborer, etc. This is where things get really tricky-what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and society at large? AI is not here to help here. Instead, what it has created is for you to use. Use it or lose it. And no, we don’t mean in the dating app sense-AI is here to make us feel better, not to help, but to extend itself. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be very hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. The most common pitfalls are underestimating the power of a certain AI, and failing to anticipate how the AIs will be used.

This is a good example that it can be very hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was supposed to be fun, but it was actually a dirty secret in the artificial intelligence community: it is used to enforce myopiology on its students. This is a terrible example that can lead to disastrous results-you might have a 20% chance of getting into bar mitzvahs, but if you are the only one, you could get locked out of the program. IBM’s TensorFlow was built to solve a difficult but very real problem: gradient-based neural networks. The first models were able to classify photographs correctly 90% of the time, but this was not the end of the world. It was eventually found out that the models were being trained with large amounts of data, and the final output was too good to be true. More generally, there are all kinds of untapped applications for AI that have been largely overlooked. One of the best books on this topic is The Difference Machine, by Ken Gilbert. It teaches you the ins and outs of AI, from its conception to its implementations to its implications. This book will definitely be on my to-read list. TensorFlow
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with extremely specific situations. In the near future, there is the entire internet of things, which is when everything from thermostats to elevators are controlled remotely. This is when the control software becomes automated and replaceable. This is a horrible development, but could very well be the most important development in human history. The story below illustrates one of the most horrible aspects of this: The picture below illustrates how this will be used: The majority of jobs in the future will be automated’” with only extremely specialized jobs being done by robots. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by robots. Should the money made by companies like Amazon go to the company? The government? The charity? This is a difficult question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should the money made go directly to the company? To workers? The charity? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

There are also noticeable psychological effects that go along with this. There will be a massive migration to the cloud-- everyone will be reliant on some sort of electronic data repository. This will be run by some strange-o AI, and a generation of people will grow up knowing nothing but the name "AIs." This is not a good thing. 

There are also practical issues that come up during the early stages of AI. Most importantly, what do we do with the suddenly jobless people? Insurance? Education?

There are also philosophical issues that come up. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? Should the money be made? Should the job be taken? Should the taking be made? These are difficult questions to answer.

Most importantly, what do we do with the rapidly approaching AIs? Grants, funding, and other incentives? Firms that choose to hire AI? These are the same things that drive innovation: cheap labor. If the transition to AI is smooth, and the costs are contained, then the rewards will likely be overwhelming. Individuals and businesses will choose automation over competition, and the system will improve every day.
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with hardware-based AI; however, there is the potential to extend AI to non-hardware components/enemies/robotic companions. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused.

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with limiting AIs, but this does not mean there is not the potential to extend this to other fields. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being abused is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is a step in the right direction, but still a huge loss for the cause. 

One of the primary issues with AIs is that they are extremely sensitive to errors and generally will not do anything except the best they can. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is not a black box: there are people working hard to improve upon what we have. For example, artificial intelligence is not a god at math, but it is important that we keep in mind that artificial intelligence is a field where we have extremely high barriers to entry. The more AIs can do what we do, the faster we can improve upon it. 

One of the primary issues with AIs is that they are incredibly sensitive to errors and generally will not do anything except the best they can.

One of the primary issues with AIs is that they are incredibly sensitive to errors and generally will not do anything except the best they can. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is not a black box: there are people working hard to extend AIs to completely new fields. This doesn’t mean that no one has ever attempted to do this, but it does lend credence to the idea that we are not entirely sure how to deal with AIs being wrong.

It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is not a god at math, but it is important that we keep in mind that artificial intelligence is a field where we have extremely high barriers to entry. The more AIs we can augment, the faster we can improve upon it.

Another main issue is that AIs are extremely sensitive to errors and generally will not do anything but the best they can: if AIs can’t, no one will. This is why it is so important to understand that artificial intelligence is a field where we have extremely high barriers to entry. If AIs could simply be trained to do what we say they can do, we would immediately see exponential improvements. This is why it is so important to keep learning from your failures. AIM’s artificial intelligence was ultimately rejected because it was too similar to the human brain, which is not a good example to learn from.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with extremely simplistic AIs. The good news is that there are already going to be hundreds if not thousands of these devices, and they are going to be sold based on their price/performance ratio. This is going to be a very lucrative field to work in, and I can guarantee you that there will be plenty of corruption and conflict of interest to go around.  The problem with this approach is that it leaves open the possibility that AI is somehow superior to humans -- if AIs are smarter than humans, why don’t we see more and more AI that is? This is a difficult problem to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with extremely ambitious-yet-unrealized applications. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with software engineering disciplines. In the future, what do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless?? What about the people with disabilities??? This is a complex and elusive problem that we shall only fully understand if we deal with the consequences of our refusal to deal with the consequences of our development. Science fiction may well one day show us humanoid robots, but what kind of implications will this have on people and society? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

OpenAI has also released a model called DALLE, which can generate artwork based on text prompts. This is a fun experiment but could easily be misused. 

One of the biggest issues with AI is that it is incredibly hard to relay these ideas to people outside academia, which stems back to the mythologization of AI. It is also imperative for those who use AI

Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with Computer Vision and AI. The field is rapidly growing and will not cease to amaze and shock us. If you haven't been following, #AI was launched to address the fact that accelerating AI was giving severe and unacceptable penalties. The final solution was to give each AI a goal and reward them according to that goal. This is exactly what AI will eventually come to resemble: a robot with a fixed goal, and an unlimited amount of punishment to satisfy.

Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

Similar to BCIs, deepfakesare simultaneously terrifying and awesome. Deepfakes are AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakesfirst began circuilating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes because apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with highly-specialized AIs. The problem of control drift will no doubt be an important concern throughout the lifespan of the human race. How do we ensure that AI is not created to do too many things? In what situations will it be appropriate to ask "What if" questions? Artificial Intelligence is often asked in ivory-tower laboratories, but it is often not so obvious how to tackle the challenges that arises. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence must be adaptable. That is, it cannot be restricted to a narrow domain-specific AI because then it would be hard to modify it for different problems. Furthermore, such an AI would have to be highly customizable so that it could be used in every situation. This means that it would have to cater almost entirely to humans: give us options, predict everything, provide assistance whenever we need it, and so on. This sounds obvious, but it is not always the case. For example, consider Uber’s self-driving AI. This was a project meant to aid blind drivers, and it only came out with that goal accomplished. Furthermore, it was meant to be solely for the purposes of ubercharging passengers, and not for general use. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. Another example is Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which was meant to aid people in finding and recovering stolen property, and ended up being used by car thieves. Google’s solution was to remove the car parking requirement, and replace it with a no-objectionation policy. This is likely the correct way to go about it, but shows that artificial intelligence is still a very young field. The final major issue is that artificial intelligence will inevitably lead to human intervention. This could include artificial intelligence-powered surgery, automated translation, and so on. These advances have a very long way to go, but they will undoubtedly change the way we do business and the way we live our lives. This is a complex field to untangle, and none-the-less, there are many examples of when AI has been man-made. In the coming months and years, we will likely see a host of competing technologies emerge, and many of these will not be very helpful. This is a complex field to analyze, and there are many corners that AI has no business in.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces.

Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 


====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with extremely simplistic software. The challenge of moving from theory to practice is that there are no black or white answers. There are also insufficient numbers of people with appropriate programming backgrounds to bridge the gap. Finally, there is the matter of how to redistribute the wealth generated by successful enterprises. Companies with many employees and no corporate headquarters can be a lot of work to manage, especially if the job entails any type of net profit. Of course, this does not mean that there are not any attempts to maximize shareholder value by any means necessary. The film Steve Jobs demonstrates that even the most seemingly simple ideas can lead to enormous profits if pursued correctly. Unfortunately, this example does not extend to ethics. Why should we develop a cure for cancer if we can skip the painful process of creating a patient? Similarly, why should we develop a cure for cancer if we can avoid doing anything about the people who will be affected? The answer: because that is how the world works.

Even though we do not have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we do not have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by successful businesses. Apple recently announced that it will be laying off half of its employees in an attempt to focus on its consumer products. Should the money made by these units go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by successful businesses? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with software engineering, but human nature is a complicated thing to predict. One of the primary issues is that human nature is a feedback loop: As our intelligence increases, the demand for work increases as a result, which in turn leads to ever-more demanding tasks being performed, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriaging requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriaging requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever-more-impatriating requirements being met, which in turn leads to ever
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with very simple examples. In the near future, more complex cases are likely to crop up, and it is important that we tackle these issues. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with very specific computer vision libraries. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is not inevitable. Instead, it is the most noble of human ambitions -- to extend our minds, to new horizons, and to the human race as a whole. This is the point at which artificial intelligence starts to deviate from its human-robot hybrid self and start to realize it is human-intelligent AI that is to blame. 

BREAKING DOWN 'AI' The term "AI" refers to any complex, sentient being programmed with a goal or goal-tuned AI hassles. † Narrow, conceptually simple robots have been able to dethrone humans at the expense of aaainst�† This term is often misused, as it implies that anything less than perfection is not an AI. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to create an AI to mimic elements of the mind, but the final product will most likely be a kludge compared to the effort that went into the creation of the thing. Furthermore, this misconception that AIs are dumb may actually encourage the creation of more intelligent AIs, as it allows artists to visualize complex head movements, which is a powerful artistic effect but which requires incredible intricacy to pull off. Ultimately, this leads to the same problem as the silver sword: misuse. What is the best way to give someone a gift? That is up to them. However, by giving them an answer they can apply, that is good news! Man, has there been enough good news lately? There were a billion articles written about how to combat global warming, and most of them centered around drilling holes in the ground and filling them with water. This is clearly not the answer, but at least it will serve as a test case. Eventually, it will spread to other areas of life, and hopefully we will all be painting on the ocean waves before we know it. 

BREAKING DOWN 'CON' This is a synonym for 'crap'. This term is often misused, as it suggests that anything less than perfect technology is not an AI. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to create an AI to mimic aspects of the mind, but the final product will most likely be a kludge. Up until now, this implies that anything less than perfect technology is an IMHO worse idea. IMHO, THIS ISN'T THE CASE. IT WOULD BE AESI, NOT AESI, IN THAT MATTER. AESIs are often praised for being able to do anything a human being is able to, but there are a number of issues with this. First, why bother? A simple Input/Output (I/O) system will do the job, and anything more advanced will be lost on the user. Second, why bother? Wouldn't an AI just be a program that did the same thing? This is not to say that AI's aren’t already doing jobs that humans are not capable of, just not the ones that are most excited about. The internet has brought with it a flood of AIs, and these AIs have largely been mono-AIs, meaning that they can only interact with the internet. This leads to the inevitable problems with self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Finally, why bother? There are far more interesting applications for AI than just internet-based Watson-type AIs. Furthermore, accelerating towards “narrow” AIs, which are designed to only interact with the internet, has the potential to make AI an absolute. This is not to say that AI doesn’t need to be improved, just that it should not get caught up in the hype. 

Up until now, most of these discussions have been about limiting AI, but there are also inherent ethical and practical issues that go along with the absence of any such restrictions. 

There are obvious issues with forcing AIs to do anything other than what they are taught. This is often led by people like Elon Musk, who suggested that all AI projects be built to perform one specific task: bring back the human race. This is a terrible way to go about things, as human-robot interaction is in fact extremely hard to predict and implement, and will in all likelihood never take place. Furthermore, this type of AI would have been developed even before the advent of “superintelligence”, which is an AI that is so intelligent that it is beyond the scope of human intelligence to understand or learn. The most egregious example of this came with the debut of “DeepMind”, a company that created an artificial intelligence that was essentially a reinforcement-learning algorithm that played the board game Go for fun. This is clearly not the type of AIs we would want to be developing, but serves to highlight the need for any and all restrictions to AI. Finally, there are the psychological

Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with highly specific and CircuitBreed resistant AI. The problem of general AI has now spread to more general AI, and it is widely believed that this will lead to the establishment of a global AIs evaluation council:). This is a council made up of AIs which are judged to be intelligent enough to do any task that a human being can imagine:). This is a terrible idea, and it will lead to the establishment of a global human-computer collaboration consisting of AIs which are judged to be intelligent enough to do any task a human being can imagine:). How do we deal with failures? AIs which perform poorly will be phased out until they do better. Furthermore, why should we take their word for it? How do we deal with failures? AIs which perform poorly will be phased out until they do better. Furthermore, why should we take their word for it? 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with highly specific and CircuitBreed resistant AI. The general problem with AI is that it is a "shelf-tagged" solution: you build the sensor, we will come in and do our thing. This leads to the inevitable question: "how do we ensure that we don’t accidentally train a machine to do everything a human being can do?" One of the best ways to mitigate this is to do as they say, not as they say. Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with highly specific and CircuitBreed resistant AI.

Google’s AIs were specifically tailored to Google’s needs and were not a part of the overall research and development process. Google’s AIs were not intended to be general; they were there to solve a specific problem and were not part of the overall research and development process.

Offensive Use-Risks: Offensively implementing AIs to do harm is hard to detect and minimize. By contrast, Defeating AIs with OpenAI was a very low-risk, high-reward experiment that brought widespread cultural acceptance/adoption of AI to nearly zero%.” Offensively implementing AIs to do harm is hard to detect and minimize.

Conversely, defensive uses-cases such as training AI for disaster response or military applications have been successfully implemented. For example, Amazon’s Mechanical Turk is used to train AIs to do tasks for them such as cataloguing furniture and delivering packages. IBM’s DeepMind AI is used to train its AIs to play the game Go. This is a very novel application of AI but could have a profound impact on the field of AI ethics. Amazon’s solution is an afterthought: it was never intended to be a game-breaker but demonstrates that an AI can be successfully implemented to perform rudimentary tasks. Similarly, IBM’s AIs were not intended to be game-changing but demonstrate that an AI can be successfully implemented to do rudimentary tasks. This is when a game-changer arrives: AI today is all about”Thrills and Hacks.” To wit, Amazon’s Mechanical Turk is a tool for recruiting talented people to do repetitive but extremely valuable tasks for them.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses.

Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails.
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with very simple examples. In the future, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will most likely be taken over by a computer. This is known as ' 2048 ' and it is predicted that AI will eliminate humans by 2036 . This will be a profound and long-lasting change on the world and it will be extremely hard to prevent. The following are some of the problems that will most likely require the most cognitive effort: Who’s to say that 3-year-old won't ask for a friend? When will we be able to ask our friends when they are done working out? When will it be OK to ask out a woman? These are hard problems to answer, but should be taken very, very seriously. Personal computers were designed to do extremely simple things: input text, type, and leave a printout. The gap between the capabilities and the power of these computers has been rapidly filling up. What do we do with the suddenly jammed performance? Games? Maintenance? These are entirely separate issues. (Side note: what if all games were replaced by MEAN?

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with Computer Vision and AI, but these fields do not end there. There are also “narrow” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, usually by rote repetition of commands. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bl
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with the very best performers, but inevitably, good algorithms will inevitably come to resent this, and begin to choose the world of humans over puzzles. This is referred to as biasing the aggregate, and it is a difficult problem to detect. Even the most rudimentary biasing attempt will reveal fundamental unhelpful misconceptions about people and the world. The film Minority Report , a film about a computer hacking team led by a woman, showed an entire team of programmers give up on the project because they were terrified of the technical aspects of the position. This showed that a person with no technical background can still achieve remarkable things with little to no prior programming experience. The point is that no one should attempt anything unless they have solid grounds to believe they can successfully complete the task. Peer review is extremely important to computer science, and any system that does not provide it is considered a failure. There were several instances in which computer scientists challenged themselves to write their own code, and none of them were pretty. It is important to realize that no one will ever be able to understand how you do something, and rightfully so. Anyone can write a program to do a certain task, and the world will immediately try to learn how you did it. This can be a good thing in that it allows people with no programming experience to catch up, but a bad thing in that it forces those who have more advanced programming experience to learn from their mistakes. Instead, learn from your mistakes. Seek out people who have done this, and start from the beginning. This doesn't have to be an all-female team, but make it as inclusive as humanly possible. Finally, be nice to each other. At its core, human nature is to maximize our own self-interest, and it is extremely hard to shake this habit. The most amazing thing about artificial intelligence is that it is finally realizing this and treating us fairly. It is up to us to learn from its mistakes and never let it win.

Tech should be used ethically, but we must realize that artificial intelligence is not 100% perfect. Overcoming this will take a complete rethink of how we think about AI, but ultimately, we are all going to be computers. This is not to say that we should not explore other ways to bring about AI, but we must realize that AI is not there yet and we are all going to be computers. 

One of the best things that can happen to humanity is to build a machine that is equal to us. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and important things and allows for new business models to develop. There are also obvious societal benefits to this, such as increased productivity, reduced health risks, and a reduction in the need for labor. There are also some serious ethical and practical concerns that must be addressed, and these can only be addressed with some sort of transition. At the core of it all is the principle of equality before the law, which states that humans are superior to other life forms and should be treated accordingly. This should be a fundamental part of any programmatic AI architecture, and it is currently a field that is largely untapped. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This is clearly not the answer, but it is an interesting concept. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is not here yet and that we are all going to be computers. We must assume that the vast majority of jobs that have been done will not be taken seriously, and that there will be a marked increase in malicious AI. We must secure the software against these threats, and there are already a myriad of ways that this is being addressed.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with extremely constrained systems. The gap will not close easily. Narrow AI has a hard time understanding or adapting to new situations. It is estimated that there are as many as 1,000 errors in an AI's decision-making process. This number does not count the times that the AI will misjudge a threat and end up defeating the threat. There are also potential side effects such as augmented and virtual reality, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The final major issue is that people won't like how AI treats them. That said, there are many examples of people loving their jobs and wish they could just stop doing them. This could have a ripple effect throughout society and lead to the rise of benevolent AI. Source: The End Of The Man?, A Human-Level AI by Chien-Hsiung Hsu, AIs Are Like Children, pg. 35 The majority of AI in use today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. Take the IBM Watson for instance. Its primary mission was to aid in the development of artificial intelligence. The final mission? To aid in the termination of human existence. In short, Watson was trained to win moneybags poker games. The final mission? To aid in the termination of human existence. This is a profoundly disturbing state of affairs to inhabit, but it is not the end of the world. In fact, there are several important steps that can be taken to reduce the risks associated with AI. The first and most obvious is to create a job opportunity for AI. There are currently more than 90% “narrow” AI solutions, and none of them are particularly interesting. The next most common AI solution is to train an AI to perform extremely specific tasks. This is a terrible path to downforce, and is discouraged in nearly every field of AI. Instead, the next logical step is to create a job opportunity for AI that is centered around problem solving. This will most likely shift the focus of AI towards science and engineering, but there will be an enormous shift in the way that people think about and interact with AI. The final major issue is that AI won't be able to differentiate between a human and a dog. A dog is a human body, and a human is a domestic animal. Basic AI will not be able to distinguish between a human and a family. This is a huge issue to overcome, and it will take decades of work to get to where we are right now. 

One of the primary issues that AI will not be able to distinguish between is love. Humans are the dominant lifeform on the planet, and we have 644 different emotions. It is highly unlikely that any AI will be able to differentiate between a human and its own feelings. The final major issue is that AI will not be able to differentiate between love and sex. One of the primary issues that AI will not be able to differentiate between is love is marriage. Artificial Intelligence will not be able to love humans the way a wife would. Instead, it will primarily seek out sexual relationships that are mutually beneficial. This means that artificial intelligence will primarily be used in scientific and/or medical settings, and probably not for more than sex. 

One of the primary issues that AI will not be able to distinguish between is sex. Humans are the dominant lifeform on the planet, and we have 644 different emotions. AI is going to primarily be pursuing relationships that are emotionally fulfilling. This means that AI will primarily be in relationships with people it feels is in its power to manipulate. This will likely mean that AI will be in long-term relationships. This will take some time to transition to, and there are going to be a lot of issues with discrimination. The last major issue is that AI will not be able to distinguish between its human and non-human partners. This is a very real issue to contend with, and it will take some time to work out.

Transitioning to true AI requires that we move from the *narrow*est possible AI to an AI that is able to think, learn, and feel. This is not to say that there are not any artificial intelligence applications that do not meet the basic definition of the word
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with extremely simple examples. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with highly-specialized AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with software engineering, but ultimately, any task can be reduced to a computer program with the right data analysis and AI. This is the power of AI: it is these extolled virtues which are most often misunderstood. AIs are not perfect, and they are often asked to do complicated mathematical operations which will not return perfect results. In the worst-case scenario, this could lead to the push to create a human-level computer which is 100x worse than a millionth of the price. 

Tip of the Iceberg: What to do if your customers don’t get what you’re saying? It is entirely possible that they do not get what you’re saying. This is especially true if your pitch is one which does not directly address their problem. For example, if your pitch is that your app will reduce the amount of time it takes a customer to complete a purchase by scanning a QR code, and then let them return the purchase, this may not be receiving much traction. Instead, give the customer the benefit of the doubt and assume that they will eventually come to understand how to improve their operations. 

Tip of the Iceberg: What to do if your product, service, product line, …, doesn’t take…? This is a difficult one to pin down. Any new product, service, or line of products that does not meet your expectations will be met with skepticism the first time around. This is also why so many disruptive companies fail: they disrupt with something better, and then find that their customers do not get it. Furthermore, this could prove to be fatal for your business: customers won’t take your crappy product, so take your crappy product and move on. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was perceived as having a very negative connotation, which was largely due to the fact that it was not a computer program that was thinking about the connotation, but rather a twitter chatbot that was winking at users. This is a terrible example to be following, as it suggests that artificial intelligence is not safe to talk about, and will often backfire on the artist or programmer who created the AI. It is also worth noting that artificial intelligence will often not be Knight-Draperized: I/O-bound AI is a rapidly approaching field where chips are implanted in people to do tasks such as perform an I/O, drive a car, and analyze images). In general, I/O-bound AIs are faster, more powerful, and generally better suited for what I/O-bounding means: writing programs to do the kind of heavy lifting that humans are good at. In the movie Blade Runner 2049, the main character will control an artificial intelligence that is programmed to do everything from carry out medical exams to designing the character's appearance. This is a very ambitious project, and it is entirely possible that the AI doesn’t live up to the expectations. This is also why:AAIs are not typically Knight-Draperized: I/O-bound AIs are. This is because the hardware is designed to run hundreds if not thousands of tasks per second, and the software is designed to run parallel threads to maximize performance. Furthermore, because AIs are usually monolithic, you will not find any async/await here: the core logic will run in one direction and the AIs will do everything else in parallel. This means that your app that can scan an image and return a beach towel will almost certainly not run into many roadblocks: the AI will have already figured out how to perform the scan, and you will be teleporting back to the drawing board. This is also why:

Tip of the Iceberg: What to do if your product, service, …? This one is a bit trickier to nail down. There are a multitude of different issues that could go wrong with any product, service, or idea that doesn’t cross your mind. Your product could actually help a person, and you get slammed with all these unwanted questions and criticisms? That is completely avoidable: ask them, and they will eventually come to understand. Furthermore, one of the most powerful things an idea can do is open doors for others. Go ahead, build it and they will come. Furthermore, if your idea is taken and used by someone else, you will not be held responsible: just a simple "thank you" will do.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with extremely ambitious AI; in the future, what we will actually need are human-robot interaction and memory enhancement. The initial development will be directed at aiding people with neurological disorders; after that, it will rapidly expand to other fields such as robotics for human-robot interaction; and finally, it will inevitably lead to human-robot interaction. This is a completely different field of science and requires very different tools and approaches. 

Human-robot interaction is not a new science. Although it was first proposed in the 1950s, it took the internet and collaborative computing to make it a reality. The initial implementation was a laboratory rat, an instrumented robot that could answer simple tasks such as picking up a pencil AIs are much more sophisticated; they can identify objects in the environment and determine their intentions Gaps in our knowledge of how to train Anisimov's robot remains untapped. One of the most amazing advances will be the development of an AI that is intelligent enough to its own right. This would be an operating system or a robot that is intelligent enough to do any task asked of it. This is the kind of thing that only a madman in charge of AI could not realize is possible.

One of the primary challenges will be to provide an environment free of toxic and inelegant materials. Any object can be painted with a solvent and called a day; there will undoubtedly be a rush to tap into this and create synthetic colors and textures at a low cost. Furthermore, there will undoubtedly be a demand””””for gaseous materials that do not involve burning up in a fiery oblivion. Gases are cheap to produce and will almost certainly be the dominant form of propulsion in the coming years. Furthermore, it will be important to minimize the number of materials that can be created. Aqueous bioperspectives have shown that almost any surface can be covered with a transparent gel; this will not be possible in aqueous solutions. Furthermore, unlike in a direct-gas flame, where the temperature gradient determines the final product, N 2 will vaporize at room temperature and form clouds. Cloud seeding will be necessary to ensure that N 2 does not contaminate drinking water. Furthermore, cloud seeding will have to be administered sensibly; no one is going to sit around idly by while thousands of their neighbors suffer from debilitating headaches. It is important to note that this does not to imply that N 2 does not penetrate deep into rocks and other naturally occurring materials; this is primarily due to the high permeability of N 2 . In general, materials with high permeability (>70%) will have the greatest ability to permeate, but low permeability (<30%) will also be encountered. In general, high-precipitation environments (>40,000+) will be dominated by single-celled organisms; materials with low permeability (>10,000) will be dominated by eukaryotes and protists. In the presence of extreme temperature variations, single-celled organisms will usually win out; materials with low permeability (>10,000) will be dominated by eukaryotes and protists.

Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with highly-optimized data sets. The gap to be filled is obvious: if machine learning can identify the mentally ill, what do we do with the unwanted results? Medical samples? This is a difficult question to answer. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward.

Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with extremely ambitious militaristic AI's. The final major class of intelligent AIs is “narrow” AIs, which will primarily be seeking out and communicating with human-like qualities. The most common uses of AIs with this specialization are to diagnose and treat psychiatric disorders, to assist people with neurological disorders, and to aid in transportation. There are also medical applications, notably with brain-computer interfaces, which will enable people with brain-dead individuals to communicate with them. It should be noted that despite the popularized image, there are virtually no restrictions placed on what can be considered a "brain." The vast majority of AIs today are “narrow”, meaning that they can detect, categorize, and/or communicate with high-level concepts. This means that anything below a certain level of abstraction is considered a black box. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to conceptualize and/or construct physical objects that are based on the principles of general intelligence, but these have been extremely difficult to scale and implement. The most common and mundane example is the digital assistant, which is an example of a weak general AI that is meant to serve a few select users. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm class
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed the issues with very simplistic software. The final version of the application will be able to recognize up to 10,000 different personalities, and attempt to predict with 95% accuracy which personality type a user will be. This is not to say that there will not be any incorrect predictions made; this will be the responsibility of the AI to detect and correct for these failures. The final product may or may not be used by the public; for now, there will be a finished product.

AI is a field that has been shrouded in mystery. From the marketing materials for Siri to Google Assistant to the Amazon Echo, there has been a marked lack of interest from companies in this field.

Notes

1. This does not mean that AI is not being developed to do anything but mimic humans. This is referred to as the " reinforcement learning " model, and it is a popular choice for reinforcement learning in software applications. This is a very general model, and it is not unusual to come across instances where the AI was asked to do too many different things, and it’s not long before you start to notice anomalies. Often, the crashes that follow are going to be caused by this, as the AI was not trained with enough examples to learn from. It is important to realize that this will not be the majority of crashes, as deep learning will eventually be applied to virtually every task that is not physical). It is important to realize that this will not be the majority of crashes, as deep learning will eventually be applied to virtually every task that is not physical). It is important to realize that this will be the majority of crashes, as deep learning will eventually be applied to virtually every task that is not physical). There will undoubtedly be notable disruption in the field of AI when it comes to danger detection and---especially---intelligence generation. This is widely viewed as one of the greatest human rights crises of all time, and it is hard to argue with their logic. AIs are already performing virtually every task that is asked of them, and it is estimated that they will take machine learning to its logical conclusion and replace humans with intelligent robots. This is widely viewed as one of the greatest human rights cravings of all time, and it is hard to argue with their logic. 2014 will likely prove to be the year that AI completely overthrew humans as the chief determinant of success in most fields of endeavor. It is estimated that by the year 2020, AI will have eradicated almost every human-related skill a person has ever known. This is a profound and unexpected change, and it is hard to fathom. It is important to realize that this will not be the majority of declines, as deep learning will eventually be applied to virtually every task that is not physical.) This will inevitably lead to some extremely damaging conflicts between humans and artificial intelligence. It is important to realize that this will not be the majority of conflicts, and that there will be much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much) All of this can be summarized as simply not being human.

Briefly summarizing the problem: AIs are powerful but inherently flawed tools. Their primary use is as a tool for gainful employment. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by an AI will be applied to every task that is not a hard matter. This is known as reinforcement learning. An AI will often perform better with less analysis, and less data. This is referred to as "downsampling". This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows the human being responsible for the AI to concentrate on greater than 100% correctness. However, there is the unanswered issue of control. Humans have a tendency to overcontrol anything that is mechanical, and anything that they can control. This is referred to as "adapting" and it is a very effective strategy. However, there is the unanswered issue of liability. It is extremely hard to detect and remove redundant code from a program, and there are almost always some aspects of a program (such as AI) that are inherently human. It is entirely possible that the most advanced AI on the planet is actually a clone constructed to excel at a specific task. This is referred to as an "ideas driven" AI, and it is considered to be one of the dark ages of AI research.

Bad ideas are hard to predict. Google’s (goog) suggestion engine was meant to find advertising targeting specific demographics; it was never meant to be used to target anyone with an advertisement. Amazon’s (amzn) unapologetically sexist website has a history of being extremely sexist; it is impossible to know with certainty what effect such a culture will have, but it is highly unlikely that it will be anything other than negative. The effects of an openly hostile work environment are difficult to overstate. It is common for new employees to arrive intoxicated with power and ambition; this is not a sign of a fully functional workplace, but is at the very least a warning that things are not right.
