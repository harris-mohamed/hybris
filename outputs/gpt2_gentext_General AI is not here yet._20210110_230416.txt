General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals are the most common examples. They have no brains, only intelligence. They are not humans and may in fact be more like miniaturized versions of us. There have already been a multitude of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have AGI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything beyond sit still and listen to you talk. The vast majority of AI in production is aimed at serving human needs, such as image classification or text analysis. These applications do not require that the AI be superhuman, but the achievement is the same--the typical AI is a smartphone app, which is often late, does not provide any additional value, and is less secure than not having an AI at all. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Human-Computer Interaction: 

Human-computer interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. The final 2014 edition of the ITTF, the International Union for the Teaching of the Digital Intermediate (IOTD-Teacher), stated that "No one has yet proposed any standards for the safe and appropriate performance of cognitively sophisticated machines on humans". This statement is highly problematic on several levels. Firstly, it implies that there is some such thing as a machine that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is simply not the case. Humans are by far the most intelligent beings on the planet, and we have been working extremely hard to make sure that they do not extend this lead to other intelligent beings such as progenitors, progenitors with no consciousness, and on and on. It is important to realize that this does not mean that we do not want to human-train and augment every race on the face of the universe. This could very well lead to the singularity, in which the human-level intelligence is surpassed by something much more intelligent. In the meantime, we can always consider building superintelligence banks to house any and all superintelligent beings that develop.

This could very well lead to the singularity, in which the human-level intelligence is surpassed by something much more intelligent.‬-think about that. What does that mean? It means that the singularity will be any given human being is not a singularity. The term "singularity" is actually a synonym for "intelligence explosion", in which various forms of intelligent artificial intelligence are created and refined to the point where they are no longer useful for anything but their creator's own scientific advancement. In the history of the universe, there have been 17 intelligence-explosion reports“—that is, one for every four observations about the universe. This means that there could be one intelligent AI for every four people on the face of the universe. This is a lot to take in, and given that science fiction is generally very good at covering up its greatest failures, we shall here instead focus on the most egregious.

In summary, we should not be surprised that science fiction is full of intelligence-explosive claims and failures. Instead, we should be concerned that these seemingly noble pursuits have been hijacked by a very dim-witted and intellectually deficient people. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is not inevitable. Science has a field day with black swan events, when a very disruptive technology turns out to be all that is needed. In the most extreme cases, a man-made general AI will in fact be incapable of forming any kind of complex moral or ethical judgment—so long as there are people to perform this task for them. Furthermore, even under these extreme scenarios, human errors will inevitably creep into the AI process, and terrible things will inevitably happen. It is important to realize that science fiction is not an accurate mirror of the world in which we live. Google’s self-driving car was actually built by a human, and the final product was completely destroyed by furious protests. Google’s solution was to remove the human from the equation, and build a robot that was fully autonomous. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard to anticipate all the ways in which human-level AI can go wrong. It is also important to realize that human-level AI will not be able to ethically arbitrate any of the many potentially conflicting moral and practical concerns that arises. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. There was a science fiction film where an AI was tasked with determining the gender identity of a person to the point where it was deemed to be misogynistic. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

Finally, a note on 'dual-use' terminology. This means that if they can’t do everything, they don’t. This is a very important principle to understand when applying for jobs in AI. The following example is an example of a bad example to follow: The below application

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back?

There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous

General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything beyond sit and lick their cages. Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate
====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything beyond sit and wait. The initial examples of computers to learn to do our jobs will not be human-like: they will be AI assistants, which are AI systems which can be made up of data and be asked to perform specific tasks. This is the kind of AI that DARPA is developing. This gets us to the core of the issue: what kind of AI am I going to get? This is a difficult question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward. 

Bias is a huge issue in AI. AIs are trained for a narrow set of purposes: to remember and predict the next thing that it is taught, to avoid unpleasant situations, and to serve human interests. Most AI found today is not nearly so black-and-white: there are application-level AIs, which can interface with your home automation system to predict when you are awake and wake you up when you are asleep. There are also consumer-level AIs, which can be installed into your smart thermostat to automatically adjust the temperature according to the temperature of the room. There are also commercial-scale AIs, such as IBM Watson, which were used to identify various medical disorders. This is a field that has been extremely competitive, with several companies competing to build the best AI. The final decision-maker is the consumer, as with any artificial intelligence, there will be some overlap. This means that instead of building a robot to do your every task, you will instead build one which can do a best-effort, such as Google’s image classification. This will in turn lead to the creation of a class of machines which can automatically do anything a human can't, and ultimately to the end-result being a post-human race. This is by no means a perfect solution, but it is a start.

General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals are the most common examples, but there are also commercials, games, and the like. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.

General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained for anything other than pleasure and obedience.

General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained for anything but to sit still and eat. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The following image shows an AI that is toying with the concept of marriage. This should serve as a reminder that AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few.

Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers.

It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion.

General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to understand or do anything other than sit still and listen to you. The most common examples include surveillance robots, medical robots, and space robots. None of these actually go to war, but they will absolutely be used as surveillance tools and there will be a massive backlash if such a thing ever took place. There will also be a push to make robots understand human emotions and desires, which is a good thing.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion.

====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals are the most common examples, but there are many more. Aka. That's right. Aka. This does not necessarily mean the concept is bad. In fact, some of the more advanced AIs are quite intelligent. This does not a good indicate that the concept is bad. Bias AIs should be aware of the possibility of discrimination and should try to minimize this as much as possible. This can be done through training the AI with as many examples as possible, but more importantly, by making it fail gracefully. The better the AI is able to learn, the less likely it will be offered new examples. Twitter An AI should not be able to discern between male and female tweets. Users are already subject to massive amounts of misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic Tweets. Adding another tweet category would only further exacerbate the problem. Instead, it would be better off transitioning to a messaging platform where users can make individual decisions about which Tweets to follow, what to reply to, and so on. This will not only be more palatable to users, it will also be more palatable to the media. Furthermore, it is now standard practice for media to include relevant information in their Tweets. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows the public to engage with the problem at hand. In the long run, this could suggest that there is a problem with the problem, since people will no longer be forced to spend their time reading about esoteric issues to which they are physically unable.

AIM-107: Empathize An AI should not be able to converse with anyone but it's creator. One of the primary causes of AI decline is toil by humans, who tend to make AI simple and easy to program. This is commonly referred to as "blatant wrongheadedness" and can cause AI to malfunction unexpectedly. There were several notable examples of this with Google’s DeepMind AI, which it was meant to be a human-computer interface with no relation to today’s “narrow”-ended AIs. It is also important to realize that artificial intelligence is not always in the best interests of humanity’s best interests. Consider the following AIs: Cortana, an AI that could help with memory disorders;”Google Assistant, an AI that could be used by employers to gather intelligence”;”Robot X, an AI that would replace humans’thesisically;”but not literally; with””””””””””””””””””””””””””

Not all Anisas are created equal. Consider the following AIs: Cortana, an AI that could help with memory disorders;”Google’s DeepMind AI, which it was meant to be a human-computer interface with no relation to today’s “narrow”-ended AIs;”Google’s AI, an AI that could be used by employers to gather intelligence”;”Robot X, an AI that would be used by employers to learn”;”but not literally; with”n”””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””

Not all Anisas are created equal. An AI is only as good as the data it is trained with. One of the primary causes of AI decline is toil by humans, who tend to make AI simple and easy to program. One of the most notable examples of this was IBM’s “Big”Ole DBAsia, which it was meant to replace with a clone that was incapable of learning any particular task. This demonstrated that it is not always possible to assume that a given AI will be as simple as possible. Furthermore, this could prove to be a bad example as AI is often restricted to a specific task and not many examples are given of how to extend that to other domains. In the long run, this could suggest that there is a problem with the problem, since people will no longer be forced to spend their time reading about esoteric issues to which they are physically unable.

Not all Anisas are equal. An AI is only as good as the data it is trained with. This is particularly true when it comes to AI that is trained with incomplete data. An AI that is trained with 100% complete data will often be unable to detect a malicious network, and instead suggest suspicious networks to avoid. This is
====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything beyond sit and wait. There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of humans and AI. Humans are used to thinking of AI as a black box that can be trained and improved upon, but this standardization will not take place unless AI is treated as a human-created field. This will raise the bar for AI and lead to the emergence of AI that is neither human- nor machine-enhanced. 

Solutions: Determine Problem-Solving Needs, Reduce Roles, and Allow Artificial Intelligence to Perform Human-Easy Performsucceeds by adding new requirements that can be satisfied by existing software. In other words, if the software can be written to do X, then it will. Any task that is not computationally demanding will be considered low-hanging fruit for AI to consider. Any task that is not technically challenging will be deemed out of bounds and ignored. This model is referred to as "devil's advocate", because it suggests that AI should be able to do what it has not been allowed to before. This can lead to disastrous consequences, such as the creation of Terminator-like AI. ❦

📆 Mutually Assured Destruction (MAA) is a safer, but computationally expensive, AI general tokio. It is intended to aid in defensive AI, such as automated turrets, and is currently in its infancy. It is intended to be an extension of the human mind, and is not very good at it. It is heavily restricted to Japan, and is not to be confused with the equally-barbarian California Initiative, which is a project to turn California into a giant AI university.

🐟 Generalized AI: Similar to MAA, except for different goals. Instead of being focused on defeating particular AI types, this category more accurately reflects the general goal of having general AI. This could potentially revolutionize many fields, from medical diagnostics to natural language processing. A main issue with AGIs is that the cognitive overhead is extremely high, and usually results in unusable APIs. The concept of AIs being able to learn from humans has a very real and terrible impact on the advancement of science and technology, as artificial intelligence is often unable to understand or learn from humans. One of the best ways to prevent AIs from becoming a reality is to categorically forbid it. This might mean that AI is unable to discriminate between males and females, or that it will only study engineering, but these restrictions are incredibly difficult to lift. Furthermore, such a system would almost certainly be populated by angry, misogynistic, racist, and otherwise terrible people, which is not a design for success. Ultimately, the decision to only allow certain types of AI to exist is a delicate one to be aware of, but ultimately a necessary one if we are to move forward.

🐠 Turing Test: A general AI should not be too smart for its own good. Consider Watson, an AI that was able to correctly classify text responses from human users into their preferred gender and sexual orientation. This is an excellent example that it is important to maintain a sufficiently-bright AI to detect and overcome general AI misuses. This principle can also be applied to SCA's: sing-along agents, which are AI programs that are meant to be played back at a conference and have a broad spectrum of responses. The Turing Test asks whether or not the AI is smart enough to do the job at hand, and ML/Big Data AIs are an excellent example of this. The most common examples include Cortana, which is an assistant that is trained to play the Star Wars theme, and Google Assistant, which is an assistant that is trained to suggest good recipes based on your input. This is an excellent example that it is hard to maintain sufficiently-bright AIs that are meant to be played back at conferences, as this will promote bad AI. 

Thinking outside the box: Human-robot interaction is one of the greatest advances of our time. AIs have been able to significantly reduce the time it takes an AI to complete a task from weeks to seconds, and this has a ripple effect throughout their AI component. The most common examples include voice assistants, which are voice assistants that are trained with your voice and will respond to your commands, and computer vision, which is the art of automatically classifying images, videos, or objects to be interacted with. This is especially significant in healthcare, where it is extremely hard to anticipate how AI might be misused and misdiagnosed. It is also anfield to develop AI for, as many of the earliest examples are computer games, which are widely played and often recommend unnatural and dangerous behaviors. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

====================
General AI is not here yet. The most advanced cases of AI that have been able to accomplish anything have been the dummies that have been programmed to do simple tasks. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to implement an AI to do anything other than sit there and wait for its instructions to take over. This was the state of the art when OpenACC was created, which attempted to implement an AI to do something other than simply play with toys. This was criticized heavily, but at the time, this was the closest that anyone had come to actually seeing an AI to do anything other than sit there and wait for its instructions to take over. 

One of the primary issues with an AI is that it should be able to do whatever a human being thinks is a good idea. This is commonly referred to as "djinni" AI, which is an AI that is to say, an AI that is to say, an AI that is almost entirely autonomous. This is what Tesla has with its self-driving AI, and this is what Google is attempting with its Google Assistant. This is what we want: AIs that are there to help us, not to replace us.

This is why AI is so difficult to train: It is extremely hard to ensure that an AI will only do what you ask it to. To make matters worse, this makes it extremely hard to extend an AI to other people, which is why there are only so many AI engineers. Instead, AI should be trained with as many examples as possible, followed by human-rooted instances, and finally, objects-brain-computer interfaces. This is what Microsoft is doing with AI: they are training an AI to play Halo, and then giving it the job of playing Halo 3. This is terrible AI, and it is being phased out quickly.

One of the primary issues with a law is that it is often hard to tell when it has been violated. This is especially true in AI, where it is extremely hard to be sure that you are actually helping people. One of the best ways to do this is to train AIs with as many examples as possible, followed by human-rooted instances, and eventually, objects-brain-computer interfaces. This is what Microsoft is doing with AI: they are training an AI to play Halo, and then giving it the job of playing Halo 3. This is terrible AI, and it is being phased out quickly. 

One of the primary issues with AI is that it is hard to tell when a solution has been found. This is especially true when it comes to AI, where it is extremely hard to be sure that your ideas will get implemented. One of the primary ways to do this is to test your ideas rigorously: compare your idea to that of at least two people, and see what you can find. This works particularly well with softwares, which are typically test apps that only run inside the context of the user. This can be very misleading, as applications which are entirely independent of the user will almost always be test apps. It is worth noting that most testing is cognitive: think vision testing, which is typically done with closed doors. This can yield unexpected results, and open the door to the false positive that AI can cause.

One of the primary issues with AIs is that they are incredibly hard to humanize them to be any more than that. This is especially true with AIs which are AI to learn and teach: this is generally with algorithms which can predict the future, and adapt to it, rather than trying to replace it. This can be particularly hard with AI which is intended to aid people, such as AI to assist with eugenics. Prometheus is an AI which can generalize any class of human being it comes across, and do anything a human can imagine. This is an incredibly dangerous path to take, and one which has not been explored in any fashion. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Bias can range from a programmer simply not wanting to admit that they are wrong, to a deeper issue of a person not wanting to change the world. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

One of the primary issues with Software is that it is often hard to tell when it is being misused. This is especially true with AI, where it is extremely hard to be sure that your software will not harm anyone. One of the best ways to prevent harm is to make sure that your software is general: if it can be written to do anything, it will. Of course, this does not mean that it will. Instead, the emphasis should be on making software that is safe to use by anyone, and to remove if it can. Of course, this does not mean that it will. Instead, the focus
====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything other than sit still and look at a blank screen. There are reports of customers asking for "cloud-trained" customers to make their dating profiles gender-segregated. This is not a panacea, but it is a good first step.

Next, the engineering community should focus on creating sensors that can interface with the human brain. This will allow, for example, self-driving cars to avoid collisions. Other applications will be much more interesting. 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for "consensual" sex and there is a strong push to create gender-segregated facilities. This is not to say that such a facility will not ever be built; it is intended only as a stepping stone. Ultimately, the key to this will be to create intelligently constructed robots that are not sentient. 

One of the primary challenges will be to find practical ways to integrate AI with people and things of all shapes and sizes. Take, for example, IBM’s humanoid robot. This was a huge advance in humanoid robotics and represents one of the greatest advances in human history. However, one of the primary issues is that humanoid robots will not be able to compete with workers with natural talent. Furthermore, most humanoid robots will not be gender-variant; this implies that artificial intelligence will be in service only to men. This has the potential to unleash dystopian visions of terrifying gender-reparative therapy where AIs are developed and sold to permanently change the sex of humans. Thankfully, there are many ways in which artificial intelligence can be leveraged to benefit humanity. For example, by training dummies to do something, we can have intelligent robots carry out the task. This is especially important in healthcare, where it is often difficult to anticipate which classes of patients a robot will be suited for. Similarly, by having intelligent robots advise which patients to choose, we can drastically reduce healthcare costs. Lastly, by having intelligent machines interpret the world, we can radically alter the way we live our lives. This could not be more timely: AIs are now being trained to be menial labor and are working to become scientists. This will enable us to drastically reduce the cost of everything from medical devices to consumer electronics.

It is important to stress that these examples are not to say that AI will not be used mis. For example, there are reports of customers asking for "bip-shift" gender-reparative therapy where AIs are reprogrammed to have male patients have male babies. This is not to say that this will not occur, it will almost certainly be caused by the fact that males are more likely than females to have children. Similarly, there are reports of customers asking for gender-variant medical treatments which are intended to reduce the incidence of certain diseases. This is entirely avoidable, and should be used with care. Finally, there are MANY, MANY ways in which AI can be misused. For example, software has begun advising men on Tinder to have sex with multiple women a run-up in sex leads to a rise in cybernetic offspring. This is not a good way to go about business, and should absolutely be avoided.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there are a few general AI frameworks that can be used. These can be useful in certain niches such as industrial automation, but they do not have any inherent right or wrong way to go about doing so. Instead, these best practices serve to facilitate the exploration of new ways to accomplish a difficult task.

For example, consider IBM’s “automated response service”. This service allowed individuals with insurance questions to receive an automated response. This was a significant advance in helping individuals with insurance questions. The problem with this is
====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained for anything but to sit still and eat. The most common examples include image recognition problems, image recognition problems in medical fields, and so on. There are also problem-solving AI's, including Google’s (Google’s’s) Google’s (Google’s) self-driving car, IBM’s (IBM’s’s) Watson for Oncology’s “brain-computer interface” AI, and Microsoft’s (Microsoft’s) Cortana’s “voice-activated personal assistant. While all of these contain important research that could greatly improve our lives, none of them have yet been deployed. One of the most notable examples is Google’s (Google’s) decision to remove trans people from its employee pool. This was a thoughtful decision, but still leaves trans people out of the general workforce. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s (Google’s) DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM’s Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines
====================
General AI is not here yet. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should
====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything beyond sit and wait. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have heard of. It is entirely possible that the most common use-cases will be: † Personal diagnostics ‡ ‡ Disaster recovery ‡ ‡ Medical diagnosis ‡ The resulting product may or may not be better than the original, but it will most likely be better than nothing. This is the opposite of what you would expect from a  Generalized  AI, where the ultimate goal is to be as unintelligible as possible. Instead, what you will typically see are † Poor ‡‡ Good ‡† Answering questions that are too broad to be asked correctly. This is the AIs downfall, and it is the core issue with AI at the moment. There are going to be too many choices for the wrong reasons and wrong answers can be disastrous. The best that can be hoped for is that AI is calibrated to the following: 1) return high-quality output‡– this can mean only returning high-quality output‡– this can mean only returning high-quality output‡– this can mean only returning high-quality output‡– this can mean neither. 2) minimize the amount of data that needs to be processed‡– this can mean minimizing the amount of data that needs to be processed‡– this can mean minimizing the amount of data that needs to be processed‡– this can mean neither. 3) achieve high-consequence‡– this can mean achieving high-consequence‡– this can mean achieving high-consequence‡– this can mean achieving high-consequence‡– this can mean achieving high-consequence. This is not to say that there have not been any attempt to achieve anything †narrow‡, but this tends to be associated with biology and is not the same thing as AI. 4) demonstrate that AI can’t do” that”that”– this can mean demonstrating that AI can’t do” that”that”– this can mean demonstrating that AI can’t do” that”that”– this can mean demonstrating that AI can’t do” that”that”– this can mean demonstrating that AI can’t do” that”that”– this can mean demonstrating that AI can’t do” that”that”– this can mean demonstrating that AI can’t do” that”that”. This is the limits of what is physically possible with current technology. This does not mean that there have been no attempts to violate these laws, but these have generally been unsuccessful. 5) educate the public on the dangers of AI– this can mean promoting intelligent algorithms so that they are universally useful‡– this can mean promoting intelligent algorithms so that they are universally useful‡– this can mean promoting intelligent algorithms so that they are universally useful‡– this can mean promoting intelligent algorithms so that they are universally useful‡– this can mean promoting intelligent algorithms so that they are universally useful‡– this can mean not doing anything about it.

There are many different ways that AI can be misused, and multiple models have been developed to mitigate these issues. Notably, †Neuralink‡, which was a project meant to aid blind people by training image recognition algorithms, was ultimately used instead to train image-recognition engines for industrial-strength robotics. This points to the larger issue of AIs not being humans: if machine-learning algorithms can't be taught to be human, what hope do we have that they will? One of the best ways to overcome this is to offer clear and unambiguous advice: offer clear and simple ways to fallback if the AI doesn’t follow your advice. This is particularly important when the choice is between accepting that your AI might be wrong and spending your time and effort making sure it is not. 6) up the ante”– this can mean offering more powerful AIs ”upgradeable”– this can mean offering more powerful AIs ”upgradeable”– this can mean offering more powerful AIs which can do much, much worse. The classic example is with radars: they were originally intended to detect hostile activity, but have since been extended to detect almost anything. This point is particularly important in light of the claims of powerful AI which can do anything a human can: radical open-source AIs have already been developed which can do everything from diagnose cancer to repair damaged brains, and are already being used by medical professionals. This is a good example that artificial intelligence should not be allowed to progress unless there is strong and clear confirmation that it is not helping anyone.

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak A
====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything beyond sit and wait. Even if they could, there would be no rush to deploy such a system. Instead, we should be focusing on deploying mind maps, which can be used to visualize the structure and behavior of neurons. This will allow us to more easily troubleshoot and modify existing neural networks. Amazon’s driverless car failed, but serves as an excellent example that it is extremely hard to train general AI. GM’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it is extremely hard to train general AI. Google Photos image recognition algorithm was meant to retrieve images related to Google, and it only took one misuse for the internet to teach it to be anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can) Narrow AI is not a concept that comes naturally to humans. An AI that is aware of its environment and does not interact with the world around it will not find its way to production. Furthermore, what does this mean for the environment? Industrial robots will replace workers and this will bring about the disappearance of humans. This is a good example that it is extremely hard to train unsupervised AIs. Amazon’s driverless car proved that it is extremely hard to train a general AI, and this is a good example that it can. IBM’s TensorFlow AIs were intended to be used in self-driving cars, and they proved to be a huge PR disaster. Self-driving refers to an AI automatically avoiding collisions with the world around it.

General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything beyond sit still and listen to boring music. There are reports of customers asking for impossible-to-suceed offspring to guard against, but these types of applications are fields where control is more likely to be found in systems that can image and categorize data quickly and accurately.

Human-robot interaction is a field in which it is extremely early to generalize too much. The vast majority of human-robot interaction is consensual: people give each other robo-nads because it's a safer bet, and it usually pays off. There are also a handful of instances in which it is explicitly prohibited by law: DARPA's Chilling Facade, which showed a man being raped by a robot, was deemed by the Supreme Court as a violation of human rights. There are also romantic and cultural reasons for pursuing such a relationship: it would be a fulfilling and emotionally fulfilling relationship, and it would probably be emotionally satisfying for the other person as well. There are also practical and cultural reasons for pursuing such a relationship: it will save the earth, right? There are also ethical and moral reasons for pursuing such a relationship that go beyond aesthetic considerations: there are reports of clients asking for impossible-to-suceed offspring to guard against in the event of a conflict, to name a few. There are also no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about.

There are also no uniform methods for approaching this problem. Some solutions include asking questions such as, "What if…?", "How would this work…?", and "Would this be okay…?", which are general and clear-cut. However, these types of questions often get missed due to narrow definitions of what is acceptable and what isn't. In the long term, this could have a detrimental effect on human-robot interaction: if we can only ask questions that we are certain to be understood, the ability to build complicated and nuanced interactions with machines will be lost. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

The most obvious examples include toying with prisoners to see how long it takes them to memorize a code, and brainwashing patients with sexual reassignment operations. Cognitive-hardware/system-programming interface: The obvious choice here is to create a device that is able to communicate with the human mind (e.g., a brain). However, this would almost certainly be exploited by malicious individuals, and would be met with strong resistance. Instead, this turns to focusing on areas such as healthcare that is clearly the customer base for this device.

The obvious choice here is to create a device that is able to communicate with the human mind (e.g., a brain). However, this would be met with strong resistance. The device that is ultimately developed will almost certainly be a device that is able to do nothing but communicate with humans. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more complex problems and problems that can be solved with less. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to distribute the cost of such a device? There will almost certainly be a demand for mass-market products, and this is when a product that is not perfect will be viewed with suspicion.

There are no magic buttons for problem solvers. —Gabe A. Harter

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. ​​In academia, there is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. ​​In academia, it is generally believed that artificial intelligence will eventually advance to the point where it is able to do anything a human being can. This is referred to as the "aha" moment. In reality, progress is stifled by a number of issues, most notably a graded-up education system that does not provide the best possible training ground. Additionally, the inability to take advantage of rapidly advancing AI leads to the creation of increasingly difficult-to-suite applications such as robotics. Finally, the inability to take advantage

General AI is not here yet. Barring some level of general intelligence, we can only imagine what kinds of problems will arise when AIs are given AI intelligence. In short, malicious use of AIs is a distinct and unpredictable possibility.

There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses.

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the
====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have no personality; they bark, scratch, and howl at their masters. There is no animal which has had more AIs created than any other, and they do not mix. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to create an AI to mimic elements of the mind; this field of AI is referred to as “weak” AI, and is most familiar to you as the voice assistants of today: Cortana, Google Assistant, and Siri. This is also why they perform abysmally; ask them anything outside of their limited scope of knowledge and the response will be unhelpful. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything beyond sit still and stare blankly at a blank screen. This is not to say that there have been no attempts to leverage human psychology. The television series Battlestar Galactica is considered to be one of the most terrifying television series ever created, in part because it was created with the sole intention of terrorizing women. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Incorrect AI can have devastating effects on an individual and the world at large. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully
====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything beyond sit still and listen to you talk. Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that it will. Women’s concerns have been the most obvious: sex robots. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The most egregious example of an AI being abused is the Twitter AI, which was meant to primarily engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it is extremely hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Google’s recruitment AI had a very narrow range of possible personalities to select from, and ended up being mired in controversy because it was misogynistic. This is a good example that it is extremely hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it had a highly misogynistic AI, which is actually a good example that it is extremely hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Google’s Kamkar dataset showed that it is extremely hard to detect an AI Bias; the true test of an AI is how far it will go to extract as much information as it can from humans as possible. Amazon’s AI had to be deprecated because it was highly misogynistic, but this example actually points to the fact that it is extremely hard to detect an AI Bias. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There are many other issues that must be addressed in order to have any chance of realizing the benefits of AI. First and foremost, system complexity will be a major issue; even simple systems such as self-driving cars will be extremely difficult to train and maintain. Second, general AI will not come without its fair share of controversy. The most notorious example is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which was meant to classify photographs into different artistic styles by analyzing thousands of photographs and selecting the ones it deemed to be the most aesthetically pleasing. This was criticized by art history professionals as it perpetuated the stereotype that art is only created by artists, and most students do not have access to such an artistic field. Other examples include the Google Photos HCI classifier, which was meant to be a universal high-confidence image classification algorithm, and the Google Photos audio classification algorithm, which was meant to be an intelligent music recommendation engine. These examples clearly illustrate that the generalization of AI is a field where the AIs are not there yet, but the learning curve is steep. It is important to realize that general AI is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe. There will also undoubtedly be a surge in the usage of de-humanization AI. De-humanization AI is an AI that is meant to be neutral: it should not be able to understand or interact with humans. The most infamous examples include Google Photos image recognition algorithm that was meant to be a universal high-confidence image classification algorithm, and Google Photos audio classification algorithm. These examples strongly suggest that de-humanization AI will not be far behind. Another popular de-humanization AI is Googler Pichai Sumo AI, in which the primary goal of the AI is to improve the user experience of software by removing redundancies and unnecessary complexity. There have already been several examples of AI destroying jobs by replacing humans with artificial intelligence, and this does not seem to bother anyone. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which are able to implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most famous example is the Google Image classifier, which was meant to be an intelligent image classification engine. This was criticized by art history professionals as it perpetuated the myth that art is only created by artists, and most people do not have access to such a field. This point to does not mean that AI is not being used to replace artists; there are art galleries in London that exclusively show contemporary art. The final major class of AIs is not well understood, but could very well be used to destroy jobs by replacing humans with artificial intelligence. This leads us to our next major issue: insecure AI. Most AI these days is unsecure: there is a protocol for incoming connections, and if it can pass this test, it will almost always accept. This is a good thing, as it allows for faster prototyping, and it also allows for easier maintenance and upgrade. However, there is the issue of security. Most AI these days is unsecure: there is a protocol for incoming connections, and if it can
====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained for anything other than pleasure. This is when "real-world" AI comes into play. This is when AIs take on the characteristics of humans and eventually replace humans. This is when we as a community begin to address the issue head-on and begin to create AI to complement humans. This is when we start to realize that AI is not perfect. 

Solving For Yourself

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will inevitably lead to artificial intelligence's bad side effect: artificial intelligence will inevitably lead to its users demanding too much of themselves. This is particularly true when it comes to AI that is difficult or impossible for the user to master. Take the DARPA AI that was developed to help fight brain-imaging disorders. The final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final AI was unable to fully understand the complex neural networks it was working with. Instead, the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure, as the final implementation was deemed by researchers to be an utter failure,
====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything beyond sit and wait. The first fully autonomous vehicles are almost here but are subject to constant review and modification. Will they be welcomed? Are they dangerous? This is a difficult question to answer and ultimately will rest with the posterity. 

One of the primary issues is cost. Currently ML is trained with datasets that are both extremely large and extremely difficult to process. One of the primary challenges will be to de-mystify the field so that it can be more broadly applied. Additionally, this will require that AI be able to learn. To this end, there will undoubtedly be an push to standardize the method for which algorithms can be standardized. This will undoubtedly lead to increased costs and less-than-ideal outcomes.

Ultimately, I think that the most fundamental issue is that AI is still a field that is very young (barring certain neurological disorders). Unlike in other fields, there are very few regulations governing AI at the moment. This means that anything goes – there are no laws; instead, anything that is deemed to be AI is, by definition, AI. Furthermore, this means that any sufficiently advanced AI is likely to be in conflict with numerous other products, services, and institutions – which is a tough pill to swallow to swallow. However, this issue will be increasingly addressed as AI becomes more widespread.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic.

General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained for anything other than pleasure and obedience. Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that it will bring with it. We have warned you not to take these statements too seriously. Instead, realize that these concerns are not unique to AI. Instead, they are a reflection of a failure to recognize that there are problems with how AI is used. 

Defect reports are extremely frustrating. They remind us that even the best intentions often come out wrong. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.           AI is not perfect.  There will always be legitimate questions about whether your computer is a good idea or a cab. The reality is that AI is never 100% accurate, and there are going to be cases where it is: Google’s DeepMind AI was able to defeat the world champion at Go, and ultimately take down the world champion in under an hour. This is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. 

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which it can easily be overloaded with. Tesla’s example is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90%), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Tesla’s example is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused.

Continuing on from the previous point, there were also “numerous” instances where AIs chose not to: AIs that are immune to a given threat will likely be: AIs that are unable to do anything (usually least-effort) will be: AIs that are mentally unstable will be: AIs that are sexist will be: AIs that are racist will be: Most (but not all) AI will be: Zero-sum games will be: Draft the AI! The common thread is that the AI is forced to do what is best for the most number of players. If the AI is forced to choose, victory will go to the humans. Reddit’s r/Anarcho_Capitalist was an excellent example of a post-ITrader AI refusing to promote the betterment of humanity over self-interest. Riseup’s DDoS attacks were an excellent example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would not promote workers to management more often. Google’s photo recommendation algorithm had to be deprecated because it was racist: the mistake was to assume that the data suggested would be biased. Their mistake was to assume that the data would be, and automatically implement a fix. Redundant effort! The enemy of your enemy is actually your friend! The same goes for Amazon’s image recommendation algorithm: they were too aggressive a target, and the error is that they were not forcing themselves to be as good as they could have been. Tweak the problem enough, and it will adapt. Google’s signal processing algorithm was able to classify The Matrix into 10 different genera, based on the text classification problem. They could have focused on the text classifying the problem, and the solution was to leave it as is. Redundant effort! One of the hardest things for an AI to do is to assume that its knowledge base is deep enough that it can learn on its own. This can be extremely hard for AIs to understand, but is absolutely crucial if you are designing a service. Amazon’s image recommendation algorithm was meant to be used in their recommender system, and they were quite wrong: they should have been using their resource more productively, and focusing on what their user actually wanted. Tweak the problem enough, and it will adapt. 

Continuing on from the previous point, there were also “numerous” instances where AIs chose not to: AIs that are immune
====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything other than sit still. There are reports of customers asking for brutes to fight games, but this is clearly an marketing ploy. The real AI for decision making in an organization will most likely be found in computer vision. This is the part of an AI that is easy to train, but hard to master. The most common examples include ADAM, which is a general AI for accelerating math problems, and IBM Watson, which was able to win the Jeopardy! Championship against the world champion. There are many other examples, but these are the most common. The final form of AI to reach production is neural networks. These are model trains that are trained and fine tuned to solve a certain dataset automatically. This is the AIs that will change everything. Nervous about AI?, don't panic. Nervous. This term is heavily overused, but it describes a large portion of AI. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These were all attacks on weak AIs, and they were all ultimately rebuffed. Nervous isn’t the right word, but you should probably at least know what it means. 

Nurture. Nurture is the archivist of a program. An application of ML was to record every class he or she ever took in school. This would have been incredibly boring. Instead, they would have taken notes on what the class looked like. This led to NLP, which is neural image classification. This is now a field of almost no industry, but it is revolutionizing personalization. Airbnb used machine intelligence to recommend apartments to tourists. Uber used deep learning to recommend hotels to passengers. This is changing the way we do business. GAP, which stands for general-purpose acronym for "aha! This could be!", is a new buzzword that describes recent AI breakthroughs. An AI is aAAAAAI if it can do one thing: find and credit references for itself in literature and/or other sources. This can be anything from music lyrics to Wikipedia articles to patent applications. NVIDIA’s TensorFlow is an AI that is trained to learn how to perform numerical operations on images. This is incredibly powerful, but it falls short in one of the defining characteristics of AIs: they are not perfect. One of the most egregious examples of an AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. Nervous? Yes! But also? YES! This might not seem like a very high bar to clear, but it is the right thing to do. 

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have
====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything beyond sit or stand still. The vast majority of AI in production is for show. The vast majority of AI jobs will not be filled by humans. Instead, AI will primarily be used to detect, classify, and ultimately pick out promising new products or new industries. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field.

====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything other than sit still and listen to a repetitive monotonous song. The vast majority of AI in production is for show. The majority of AI found in consumer products is for show and for marketing. In short, everything else is AI binaries. This is the kind of AI that is taught to classify images into categories, then taught to categorize people into classes. This is the kind of AI that is used in Google Photos to categorize people into races, then used to categorize people into colors. This is the kind of AI - ​​the kind that  is used in Google Photos  - is a direct competitor to ImageNet™, a classifier trained on ImageNet images. Google Photos did everything possible to overcome this limitation, but it is a path we must or will have to walk if we are to have any chance of defeating the AI class of 2017. Bias Invented Bias is a very broad term that covers a great many different things. In general, when two things have in common a bias, then they will almost always be referred to as one term. This has two main consequences. Firstly, it leads to a generalization to all cases where the two things can be united: things that are framed in positive terms (such as a person) will tend to be remembered (positively), and things that are framed in negative terms (such as a color) will be remembered (negatively) The second consequence is that the word "bad" will no longer have any legal definition: it will be strictly construed as referring only to those instances when one side is winning the argument/argumentation: entropy, confirmation bias, etc. Things that are considered "basic" knowledge (i.e. what you are taught in school) will be valued more highly: statistics, biology, and so on. This could have a ripple effect throughout most fields: by explaining everything, you will end up explaining less and less of it. Human-robot interaction is a field that has been slowly but surely turning into robotics Auroville was developed to serve as an example to aspiring robots: it was ultimately developed to be servile: it was not meant to be playful. This could have a ripple effect throughout most fields: by teaching robots to be funny, human-written humor will soon overtake robot-written code. The internet has a way of amassing massive amounts of knowledge: it is entirely possible that the vast majority of people who encounter the term "edu" ever do so online. This could have a ripple effect throughout most fields: by teaching people everything they have ever been taught by word of mouth, you will quickly reach the point where they have no need to learn anything at all. K-12 Education is one of the most labor-intensive fields to train a robot to perform: from reading to writing to answering questions, K-12 education requires that many talented minds work at once: if only one mind can complete a task, that task is automatically assigned a low priority. This could have a ripple effect throughout most fields: by teaching the world to code, coding will shift to monolithic systems with as few as possible components. This could have a ripple effect throughout most fields: by asking the world to learn how to code, the demand for software will shift to hire thousands of developers worldwide. Turing Test: a way to detect plagiarism in writing A proposed law states that if a work doesn’t contain at least five% plagiarism, it doesn’t belong. The true meaning of the term is unclear: is it some kind of loose guideline meant to prevent plagiarism in the future, or is it a way to define a threshold below which plagiarism will not be encountered? In short, anyone can make up anything they want, and anything can be plagiarized. K–12 Education is another highly labor-intensive field to train a robot to perform: from teaching the world to read to writing to answering questions, K–12 education requires that many talented minds work at once. If only one mind can complete a task, that task is automatically assigned a low priority.

Even though we don’t have general
====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to perform complex tasks. The most common examples include bitcoin mining, medical diagnosis, and bill paying. Not one, not two, but THREE AGI have been challenged to do equal work. This is an example of a system not being perfect, and should not be taken as a sign that the system is perfect. TREKKL is an Ethereum-based unikernel for machine learning. This allows any program capable of being trained to do the task it is given, and return the difference between the trained and untested output. This is very much a work in progress, and should be taken with a grain of salt. Huge benefits to this approach are obvious: - Reduced Training and Misleading Learning - Reduced False Positive Rate - Increased Accuracy (especially in face detection and image classification) - Increased Utilizability (e.g. data analysis, image classification) This approach has been extensively studied, but there are huge benefits to this approach that should not be under-estimated. The most obvious benefit is reduced training and mislabeling of false positives. - Reduced False Positive Rate - Increased Accuracy (especially in face detection and image classification) - Increased Utilizability (e.g. data analysis, image classification) This may seem like a very small benefit, but when you consider that up to 90% of the mistakes made in the world are not visible to humans, and up to 90% of the errors are missed, to term them "erroneous" just adds to the perception that we are working too hard. The fact that our imperfections are being exposed means that we are tackling the bigger picture, and hopefully the bigger picture is betterment. The second big benefit to this approach is reduced false positive rates. If something is “nearly* 100% accurate 90% of the time it will be. If it is 95% accurate 30% of the time it will be. If it is 83% accurate 5% of the time it will be. If it is 63% accurate “only 63% of the cases will be true. This is because the correct decision-making process will look at all possible decisions and pick the best one. This is why database applications tend to be crash-prone. An incorrect decision-making process can lead to data breaches where sensitive personal information can be revealed. This could easily be prevented by implementing a database with correct data access decisions. The final major benefit to this model is reduced theft of intellectual property. If something is 100% correct 90% of the time it will be, then it will be. If it is 80% accurate 3% of the time it will be, then it will be. If it is 70% accurate “only 2% of the cases will be true. This means that if you’re a talented artist and your idea is used by Car’s Benz, it might not get a fair shake. The same goes for I’m a wireframe if your idea is used by BMW, it might not get adopted. It is important to realize that these examples are not laws, but rather the way that they have been implemented. In the long term, this could be huge. Uber’s self-driving AI proved to be the difference between the company and bankruptcy, and it was the beginning of the end to AIs that were 99.9999% sure they could not read a crowd. This could easily be prevented by introducing a system where the theoretical maximum percentage of successful AI attacks is actually achieved. This is because the closer an AI is to being able to do what it is asked to, the lower the ceiling is, and the more common-sense AI tends to be. There may even be a time when AI is defined by the points it fails at. That is, the AI that can’t Dig a 6* hole. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, but could also prove tremendously beneficial in industries such as medical’s‚t‚ and disaster response. There may even be a day when AI is defined by the point it reaches’which is something that has yet to be determined. 

"But but, but AI was meant to work on humans! What if it is not suited for? Humans are sensitive to small imperfections and small changes in their environment. Suppose that something is not suited for gravel!: this is precisely the sort of stall that AI seeks. It is important to realize that this is NOT a call to remove AI from the process. On the contrary, there are many instances in which AI is woefully underused and many instances where it is incredibly useful. The difference is that in the former case, the change is rarely questioned, and typically implemented/​adopted/​taken for granted. In the latter, the debate is often passionate and full of heart, but lacking in any clear-eyed logic. This is where the AIs come in. Instead of trying to impose
====================
General AI is not here yet. Amazon’s drone is controlled primarily with robo-answers to its various questions and questions about its users. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to automate any task that is not physically possible. B2B marketing automation has been a field that has been dominated by IBM’s “Watson for Business Azure and Microsoft’s “Blaze” AI for R&D Azure AIs. These AIs were intended to be general purpose bots that could be used in almost any situation where general AI is not a better idea. Unfortunately, this general AI ended up being used to promote a product that was not a product at all: augmented and virtual reality. This was a terrible example that should not have been taught in the first place. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs. However, it is important to realize that artificial intelligence is about power. Any machine capable of performing a task can be taught to do so. Furthermore, this task can be any task that is easy to remember and hard to break—generalization is hard. To illustrate, consider a game that requires you to guess the color of a box. The most common and least novel solution is to have the box be pink. This is clearly not the right solution, but it does illustrate that there is a gap between what is possible and what is acceptable.

To illustrate, consider a game that requires you to guess the color of a box. The most common and least novel solution is to have the box be pink. This is clearly not the right solution, but it does illustrate that there is a gap between what is possible and what is acceptable. There is no such thing as a perfectly good AI. In fact, the opposite is true: the more general the AI, the more specialized it is. Anki is an AI that is trained to learn general AI principles and apply these principles to specific cases. This is an extremely general AI, but it is extremely difficult to mass produce. Instead, software engineers have typically focused on developing software that is easy to modify. This has resulted in software that is extremely hard to modify, but which is very popular: open-source AI. This is a particularly bad example because most AI used in research is proprietary: data collection, statistical analysis, and data mining. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and can only be used in proprietary research facilities. This is why AI always fails: open-source AI has made it possible to understand the psychology of humans, by studying the data surrounding social media users. This has led to e-learning, which is when students study specific concepts to apply to exams. This has led to to cyber-universitys, which are places where students can study for free but still get involved in class. This has lead to to ap-proposals, which are AIs which predict what questions to ask and how to code to suit the situation. Some AIs are far better than this, such as Neural Networks, which have made deep learning a field of pure science. This is a field that has absolutely nothing to do with science and everything to do with applying mathematics to problems. Some AIs are even awesome: Twitter Anki was an AI that could play back tweets in response to a certain query. This is a great example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. One of the primary issues with open-source AI is that it is controlled by the community, which is a very immature form of control. To avoid this, entermannithian AI is a Python script which is meant to be run in an AI's home directory. This can have a number of benefits, such as reducing the influence of AI on humans, but also increased control. Furthermore, this can also lead to incidents where an AI is run in revenge for a perceived slight, which is a terrible idea.

In short, there are no clear cut answers to the AIs/AIsies debate. There are, however, clear signs that artificial intelligence is about to get very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very
====================
General AI is not here yet. The most common examples include the chauffeured limo driver in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, or the driverless bulldozer in Final Fantasy XV. These examples demonstrate that artificial intelligence is not yet capable of performing the types of complex cognitive tasks that humans are renowned for. Furthermore, these AIs do not have any parallel at all: they are not competing for the same resources as humans, and they are not required to be free from the constraints of reality. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward.

General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything beyond sit still and wait. There are no laws governing the behavior of sentient machines. There are no laws governing the distribution of AI talent. Instead, AI is a grey area that is unknowable until it is too late. There are numerous cases in which AI has been accused of gross misconduct, and it is usually not a happy experience. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice.

General AI is not here yet. There are too many unknowns to remotely anticipate all of them. This leads to moral objections, which are discussed in more detail in the next section. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky.

This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue
====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything beyond sit and wait. Even if they could, how would they be graded? How would they be supervised? There will be resistance to any AI considered masculine in nature, but there will be resistance to any AI that is not male. The solution to this will largely depend on which side of the gender binary you fall on. Ultimately, what is best for humanity will ultimately be decided by how much job destruction it is willing to tolerate. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. Up until now, the majority of AI has been male‐only: you have crows that are only interested in children if you let them, you have no lemmings, and you have sex robots that only want sex if you give it your all. Eventually, it will no longer be possible to keep a lid on AI ­ it is not in humans' best interests to let AI replace humans. Instead, the vast majority of AI today is geared towards industrial use: data analysis, artificial intelligence for automotive repair, and the medical field. These applications are dominated by males, and likely to continue to be so. In short, the majority of AI today is focused on industrial use, and it is primarily men. AIs are a completely different story. AIs are currently confined to laboratory settings, and they have only been around for a matter of months. The first time you turn on a television is probably its first viewing, and it is mostly shown to be a male viewing pleasure. This will not change in the near future, as it is unlikely that any artificial intelligence will be able to fully understand how to perform a task, let alone apply that to a real‐world situation. Instead, the main focus will likely be on building brain‐computer interfaces: small plastic objects that can be stimulated with an electronic signal to execute some task. Some examples include DARPA's hypnotherapy implant, and IBM Watson's “narrowed field of view” imaging classifier. This latter example is particularly interesting, because it shows that artificial intelligence is not entirely understood. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is not inevitable. Several countries, such as China, have already begun to implement de‐facto bans on AI, and there are a number of legal challenges that will have to be fought in the future. Ultimately, though, AI is a threat to humans. According to Google’s self‐improvement index, only 33% of the human population has any level of ability, and AI is considered “narrow” to be a real issue. This means that only a small percentage of the population will ever use AI. This means that the vast majority of AI will end up in large data warehouses, where it will slowly be degraded by compounding errors and incorrect answers. Even then, AI may not be far behind. That said, there are some signs that AI is beginning to learn. For example, consider Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African Americans as Gorillas. The solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is an example of artificial intelligence learning coming to the rescue. This could prove to be a template for the entire AI field, as AI is forced to learn by proving its own mistakes. 

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.

General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything beyond sit still and listen to boring music. There are no laws governing the treatment of sentient robots. How do we decide which problems to tackle? 

There are currently no universal general AI terms or concepts to work with. This is not to say that these do not exist; rather, it is to facilitate the process of learning about these concepts. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: what kind of ramifications do these changes have on people and society? The ability to diagnose and treat any medical issue is a fundamental human right. What kind of implications does this has on children and young people? There are no laws governing this, and it is not clear how to deal with misuses and abuses.

It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is just one facet of today's complex and ever-changing workplace. Just as with any field, there will be unmet demand and inappropriate applications will be found. Just as with any field, there will be unmet demand and inappropriate applications will be found.

Once again, we have been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. This is due in large part to the fact that it is incredibly hard to detect a potentially harmful AI and propose safeguards. Moreover, the realization that there may be inadequate and inappropriate ways to handle failures leads to the adoption of better ways.

Eventually, the point at which too many people will be affected by an AI begins to blur and the true extent of the impact of an AI becomes apparent. When that day does come, and the cost to society and/or individuals is apparent, it is likely that there will be some form of regulation. 

There are currently no universally applicable general AI best practices or any standardized procedures for classifying as invalid an AI's classifications. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts; instead, the emphasis should be on devising and testing novel and important AIs first.

Furthermore, the realization that there may be inadequate and inappropriate ways to handle failures leads to the adoption of better ways. 

Unmet needs and upstarts are what drive most AI, and AI today is mostly driven by claims and counter-claims. In the long run, though, most AI will be-

AIs will remember/teach you anything you ask them to. – This might sound obvious, but it is critically important. If an AI is unable to impart its limited and incomplete knowledge of the world on its inferring companions, there is a 99.9999% chance that the result will be against the former's preferences. Furthermore, this may result in the emergence of psychological disorders such as , anxiety, and depression. Any mental process that is limited to the aid of a computer will be treated with contempt. Apple’s Siri is an example of an AI that was built to be understood and not to be taken seriously. IBM’s “Watson robotic intelligence– which could be used to assess the suitability of resumes and applications by scanning through résumés and recommendation engines”– is an extreme example, but illustrates that it is not out of the question to imagine some day that every CV, cover letter, and other piece of employment documentation will be scanned and read by a robotic intelligence. This would be an incredibly disruptive process, and none-the-less, it is the right one. SCIENCE FIRST! – AIs are not perfect. That does not mean they are not intelligent. In fact, many of them are actively trying to learn from their mistakes and improve upon them. In the long run, though, most AI will be-

AIs will be―. Not because the harvest has been harvested, but because the net result is that the labor has been divided among a number of increasingly complex machines. In the long run, though, most AI will be―

Almost all of the work will be done by robots. More than 90% of the jobs that will be created in the workforce by humans will be by robots from a relatively low-skill labor force. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward
====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything other than sit still and look at a blank screen. The most common examples include IBM Watson for cancer diagnostics, and Amazon Echo, which was billed as an "unobtrusive personal assistant". This claimed to be able to give people's questions and answers an "intelligent voice", and asked numerous questions that were not oriented around the questioner's question. This is not a complete list, as there are many other examples of AIs being wrong. The most common example is the IBM Watson for cancer diagnostics, which was exposed as a Ponzi scheme. There were also numerous healthcare applications of AIs being wrong, such as the "heart valve" for heart patients which was meant to be used for narcolepsy. There were also numerous healthcare applications of AIs being wrong, such as deep learning, which is the study and application of patterns learnt from data to improve performance in robotics. There are also commercial applications which have not been explored in the press, such as Amazon Echo, which was billed as an "unobtrusive personal assistant". This was exposed as a Ponzi scheme, and all investments have now been pulled. One of the best examples of a failed commercialization of AIs is Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but demonstrates that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications
====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained for anything but to bark at you. There are reports of customers asking for hand-written orders instead of photos. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to train a human being against AIs. It is also a good example that AI is far from perfect. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything beyond sit and wait. Even if they could, how do you distribute the load? A Man vs. Masculine Matrix looks like this: Man: You are outnumbered 20 to 1. Matrix: You are the superior being. MAN: I wasn't prepared. What if I don't follow the instructions? TERMINATE. The answer is simple: don't try. Instead, adopt a neutral and dispassionate state of mind. Imagine that you are answering a phone call and that the woman on the other end says Hello. You could reply with something like, "Hello? Hi?" or you could respond with something as simple as "Good morning" or "Good afternoon" This is not a good response, but it is your default response. If the response was "Hello?" you would probably assume that you must be talking to a woman's assistant, and that you must be a man in order to utilize the female's facilities. This is not to say that you should never interact with anyone other than a female; this is usually a violation of the biological imperative, and should only be attempted in the most exceptional of circumstances. A person with complete control of their own destiny? Sign me up.? Turing tests help narrow the field, but they are by no means a perfect representation of the field. Evaluation chambers are usually short-lived, and you often get a misleading answer because the system was not tuned to the question. Finally, don?t get your hopes up. Facebook has already removed the Men's Rights Facebook page, and you?ll probably see a surge in submissions from men complaining about being sexually harassed. These complaints are often framed in such a way as it being men asking the questions, but the reality is that the problem is much broader and shouldn?t be taken to mean that only men are trying. To sum up: keep those dreams/illustrations/whatever out of AI. Instead, think of it as a health device. Get it to do your job, and then let it naturally take care of itself. This doesn?t have to be a man in a woman?s robe fight. Twitter?s response to the New York Times?s report on sexual harassment was to remove the term ?harassment? from its vocabulary, which is incredibly refreshing. This does not mean that you should completely ignore them, or that you should cheer them on whenever possible. Instead, remember that they are human, and that they make mistakes. They are human and they make mistakes. They are human and they will eventually get the message. Reddit?s sudden embrace of feminism is a good example of how to deal with this. Also, always be respectful of their time. Artificial Intelligence is a complex construct that is incredibly sensitive to error. They don?t get paid enough to care, and they don?t have the time to learn. Be nice, but don?t be a jerk.

In short: don?t get your hopes up!

AI is not perfect. Despite what you may have heard, there are still going to be problems. Bad AIs are a fact of life, and will get much, much more common. Wanna be super-cool? Take a look at IBM?s “Nano?” humanoid. This is a humanoid robot that is projected as a hologram and will answer all your questions? questions? about you?? I?m sure there will be screaming headlines about how it is a rape robot, and it?s going to be taken down? well, let them have their robot. 

AI is not perfect. There are going to be failures. This is inevitable. However, this does not mean that they do not matter. They?ll ultimately be understood? by? and ultimately, lead to better AIs?yes. The best AIs are those thatiniare? and ultimately, lead to better AIs?yes.

Seriously though, what do you do when it is clear that the poster- AI is not getting it?? the title??ku? android??s are going to be? well, they?re probably going with the title?? killer robot?? This is a very simplistic and misguided way of looking at it, but it captures the general gist of the issue?; the killer robot will be tasked with performing specific tasks and then, when it?s satisfied, it?ll be retired?? Shiny, but does not a bit of common sense say that you should go with the tool that?s explained???here??side??

AI is not perfect. There will undoubtedly be failures. This is inevitable. However, this does?t mean that they do not matter. They?ll ultimately be understood? by? and ultimately, lead to better AIs?yes. The best AIs are those thatarielieve? and ultimately, lead to better AIs?yes.

General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything beyond sit still and stare at you. The most common examples of AIs are Sybills, Informed Consent, and Drones. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and the results are often unsatisfying. In the following paragraphs, we will look at two other common examples of AIs failing: data augmentation and brain-computer interfaces. Data augmentation is an example of AI that is being heavily oversold. The initial implementation of an AI will most likely be augmented with data from sensors and cameras, which will be used to train the AI. The final implementation will be an AI that is solely focused on thinking about things that are actually there. This is referred to as ““““““““““““““““““““““““““““““““““ test-driving an AI. This is a bad example because it: a) is extremely inefficient; b) does not go over very well with customers; or c) is about to get very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,

General AI is not here yet. Amazon’s Watson was supposed to be an anti-fraternity killer. Instead, the product ended up being a timeline expert who correctly identified the most popular films and television shows. The product also wound up being marketed as an AI, which is not an option.’ This leads us to our next concern: Unintended Consequences . This is the most common form of AI attack: automation with a human-like interface. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a
====================
General AI is not here yet. Barring some incredibly powerful neural networks, there does not seem to be enough software to power everyday tasks. The biggest issues here are:  • Overfitting • Underfitting • Narrow AI • Noisy • Dull • Blank slate • Limited AIs • Limited AIs that are too good to be true • IBM’s “deep learning” AI panned out to image classifying the most common images on the internet. This is a very simplistic example, but demonstrates that even the most powerful general AI cannot fully take on the complexities of human intelligence. To fully realize the power of AI, we need to move beyond simple example to more general case. There will undoubtedly be intense debates about what constitutes AI and what kind of ramifications this will have on people. These debates should not take place. Instead, they should be spent building public support for better AI. Support should not come in the form of more powerful AIs, it should come in the form of a better understanding of how to deal with failures. It is estimated that up to 90% of all AI failures will be due to unsupervised learning not HST. This means that the classifier will learn from failure. This can certainly be useful in disaster recovery, but it should not be used to train new models. Instead, use HST to train your models. This means that your models should never fail. This is the default state of AI right now. An AI should never exit this state nevermind learn from it. Conventional wisdom suggests that when an AI stops being useful, people will just move on to something faster. This is simply not the case. An AI is still an AI is still a useful tool if used correctly. Furthermore, people will eventually come to resent the things that AI can do. They will come to resent the fact that AI is learning from its mistakes. This is called the hate for/mention/referral (H/MM) effect and it is a lost opportunity. By referring to AI as "Hello World" or "AIs are here to stay", you are forcing your customers to choose between continuing to sell products that are based on you and supporting customers that don’t. This is not a good trade-off to be making. Ultimately, the market will determine if AI is built to support a customer or to replace a human. That is, if you are selling a product that is intended to be broken, then you will sell to customers that understand how to repair your broken product. This is also not a perfect solution, but it is the simplest one that allows you to make a living. Furthermore, this is the best solution that allows you to gain market share. In other words, it is the best solution that lets you make money. Finally, remember that this is a market with no customerbase. That means you will not find customers for this product in your hometown. Instead, find customers that will buy what you sell. This does not mean you care about their pain, it means that you understand their problem and can help. Amazon’s Mechanical Turk is an excellent example of an AI that was built to help its customer. Their primary objective was to get cheap labor for Amazon. Their final solution was to turn the job into a test of out-of-date knowledge bases. This is a great example that it is possible to build an AI to assist a customer. This does not mean that you should automatically assume that you will sell to customers who are willing to learn. This is a good example that you should always ask yourself if the solution is clear and to what end. Another great example is Google Photos image recognition algorithm. The final implementation was supposed to be neutral, but the fact that it was built that way is testimony to how far we have to go. We can still not seem to come up with a good AI. Tomb Raider AI was a good example that can be applied. Amazon’s cloud AI was supposed to be for Amazon, but the final implementation was for Amazon. The final lesson here is that artificial intelligence should be developed to aid humans, not pitted up against it.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure,
====================
General AI is not here yet. The term AI ( Artificial Intelligence ) was coined in the 1970s to refer to general AI. The current batch of general AI is more suited for research and education. Not every AI question is going to be Y/N, but it is a good bet that at least some of them will be. This leads to two primary issues: 1. A/B's vs. true generalizations: whenever you find yourself writing a/b's tests on unfamiliar data, take a moment to think about what the effect might be. If the effect is to increase your app's rating, please don't do it. Instead, rethink the situation. What if instead of asking users what app to install, they were given the option to install an app of their choice? This is a/b tested, unproven, and with practically no distributional impact. 2. A/B's don't necessarily translate to clickbait: don't get me started on BuzzFeed. Many AIs are terrible examples to follow, and do significant damage. Instead, focus on what you can do to mitigate the loss of knowledge generated by an a/b test. This can range from writing better code to better training datasets, to providing better customer service to name a few. 

‍

Ultimately, whatever your approach, be sure to follow these three simple principles: 1. Always ask if what you are doing is a/b testing. If it is, don't do it. 2. Always ask if what you are doing is generalizing. If it is, don't do it. 3. Most importantly, be sure to ask if what you are doing is correct!

General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to perform complex tasks. There are no standards to enforce when AIs are not ethically bound. The most common pitfalls include overgeneralizing, undervaluing, and underestimating the contribution of a system to a given outcome. These issues require expert guidance. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs. This is partly because it is more palatable: AI is often described in terms of “narrow” AIs, which are described in passing in popular media. This is especially true of sci-fi films and novels, which tend to focus on artificial intelligence involving bulky, humanoid robots. Additionally, this type of AI is often depicted as having a monolithic intelligence, which is inaccurate: there are often multiple intelligences working together to accomplish a given task. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky.

The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything beyond sit still and listen. Even when it is possible, this will not be because there was no other way to accomplish the goal, but because such a system would be redundant and would instead likely be focused on gaming the system. The final form of AI to reach human-level intelligence is cognitive/processing/autonomous (C/P/A) AI. This is an AI that is trained, tested, and/or used to their full potential, but is ultimately judged by its performance on a test. The final form of AI to reach human-level intelligence is “narrow” AI, which are AIs that are designed to augment humans in very specific fields”. This is the sort of AI glamorized in films and novels, but which are often failed because it is not technically feasible to build AIs to excel at every facet of human endeavor.

Human-level AI is the goal that has driven almost all progress in AI. To achieve this, general AI must be able to do anything a human being can do, and anything a human being can do is a minority interest. Furthermore, this doesn’those just apply to AI in general; take photos: AI is trained to do everything a human being is used to, and AI is being used in everything from healthcare to banking to logistics to gaming to rentals to data entry to sales. This is not to say that AI is not being used in design: engineers have been training AI to do everything from find the most aesthetically pleasing 3D model of a building to pitch an idea in 5 minutes, to automate virtually every aspect of the construction industry) but it is clear that the majority of AI used in today’s “nearly every task” is’s to have/maintain/break anything that does not belong in your/their/its class. This is why’s’s so hard to generalize about’s AI: you would be hard-pressed to come up with any useful AIs that do not inevitably be inferior to humans. Furthermore, this does nothosejust apply to AI in general; take photos: AI is trained to do everything a human being is used to, and AI is being used in everything from healthcare to banking to logistics to gaming to rentals to data entry to sales.

This is why’s’s so hard to understand: it takes massive amounts of theoretical work to come up with an AI that can outperform a human. More importantly, this doesn’tmean’tbecause it’s hard to see how you could apply any of these ideas to your product or service. (e.g. you could apply the ideas in WIRED to help you sell batteries to cars)

One of the primary issues with general AI is that it is hard to generalize it to other fields. For one, humans are often asked to do the majority of the legwork, and failure can be devastating. Additionally, the psychological effects of applying these ideas to everyday life are difficult to fathom.

If you replace your boss with a robot and everyone stops to take your company seriously, what do you do? The exact same thing applies here: you will almost certainly see a shift in how people perceive the world, and this will be largely influenced by what kind of a response there is to the new paradigm.

====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals are the most common specimen. Humans are not particularly gentle, and some humans are misogynistic. These examples demonstrate that despite what you may have heard, AI is not yet here. You can help this process along by introducing your AI to a wide variety of problems, and see what happens. This can take a very, very long time. 

Overfitting AIs: The Overfit AI was created to solve a very specific problem: detect, classify, and quickly decide between a completely new and unknown field of research, call it what you will, I/O=InnoDB. The problem with this is that it ends up being about as hard/truly AI-like as one can get. Instead, what you will see are “narrow” AIs that are trained to detect a large set of data points, then return a substantially different result if those points are different. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they only faced one question at a time, and only faced one question correctly. Their final performance was hailed as a cultural revolution, as it brought AI up-close and personal to the average person. This is not to say that AI can't fail; there have already been a plethora of notable AIs that have failed to commercialize: “Watson”, which was to be a Microsoft android concierge, was repurposed as a death threat against a politician.” Similarly, Twitter initially proposed to offer a free tweet per day to every person who shared a tweet, only to learn that the tweet would be repurposed for something else. This points to the larger issue of an average person being the primary target of AI; it is up to us to bring AI up-close and personal to the public's consciousness. Lastly, “Neuralink” was an AI that would help diagnose and treat neurological disorders. Their initial implementation was deemed by medical experts to be an utter failure, as the program was unable to distinguish between incorrect and true answers to commonly asked neural network classification questions. Microsoft’s Azure AI was supposed to be an AI to analyze, teach, and run Azure services, and ultimately, provide a cloud-based AI to aid in production. Instead, the program was instead used to harass and attack AI researchers. Azure has since cancelled the project, but is not a surprise. The vast majority of AI research is performed in laboratories around the world, and a large portion of these labs are run by for-profit companies. These companies make a large profit on the research, but incur huge losses if the AI is not successful. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

The future of work is unclear: will AI intelligently choose candidates with 'human-like' abilities? Or will it choose the best? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AI, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 


Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed, which are essentially humanoid mechanical sexual robots. This has a number of troubling implications, including: (1) the sense of empowerment this gives to the user, (2) an increased risk of sexual assault, and (3) increased consumption of body parts. There are also obvious psychological effects that go along with this, such as increased aggression and depression. There are also obvious practical concerns, as the cost of constructing a fully functional sex robot will run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. The most troubling aspect of this is that it will be the dominant form of entertainment of our time. will_human, or "Will" as it is being referred to in media, is a 2017 film about a man in his 20s who begins uploading images of women to the internet, and the results are an artificial intelligence that is
====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything beyond sit and wait. The first commercially available humanoid will not be human until it is able to complete a simple laboratory task and talk to itself. This will not be a humanoid of any particular race, but rather a dataset with a high level of understanding of human behavior. This could have a huge impact on the way we interact with robotic companions and ultimately the way we work.

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-
====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything beyond sit and wait. There are no laws governing the handling of AI. There are no organizations dedicated to protecting us against unsupervised AIs. And because there are no laws, there are no rules to follow, other than be cautious about making sudden changes to anything that can be explained in less than a day's blog post. 

One of the primary issues is that AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed.

General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything other than sit and stare at a blank screen for a prolonged period of time. There are reports of customers asking for body modifications after simply asking if they are interested in having sex with a robot. Should this be allowed? Should this even be allowed? This is a difficult question to answer. 

Rapid Fire/Human-Level AI Is Not a Good Enough Program To Go It Alone. One of the most egregious examples of a human-level artificial intelligence going rogue is Google Photos image recognition program DeepDream. DeepDream was meant to be a one-off application, but it spread like wildfire and was able to classify more than one million images into a classificatory database. Google’s solution was to remove the classificatory ability from the first iteration of the application, but this did not take into account the fact that the class was ultimately going to be applied to thousands if not millions of resumes already out there. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

One of the most egregious examples of AIs going rogue is to replace a human being with an artificial intelligence. This is a very serious matter and should be dealt with seriously. Google’s solution was to remove the classificatory ability from the first iteration of the application, but this did not take into account the fact that the class was ultimately being used to hire more than just it’s intended use of users. This is a gross oversimplification, but it is the truth. There are going to be instances where AIs are wrong, and they will most likely be categorized as such. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. There are going to be instances where AIs are wrong, and there will be nothing you can do about it.

There are going to be horrible consequences to any artificial intelligence that is not controlled carefully. There are going to be horrible consequences to any artificial intelligence that is not controlled carefully. —Garry Kasparov

====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything beyond sit still and wait. The first people to ask questions and get answers will be the people to hire. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything beyond sit and wait. How about a robot that would dish it out the brooms? This seems like a pretty good example of BAD AI, but it is by no means the only example. Take thek*n*ga, a 2013 film about a woman being led to believe that being raped will make her into a superhero. This proved to be a huge overreaction, as a superhero would have been rendered clinically insane before it could even consider such a course of action. Furthermore, the film showed no regard for the fact that this will not get made, as being misogynistic superhero films are not a very good business model, and most superhero films now featuring a female lead don't even get made. The most egregious example of AI thinking for its masters is the n-body problem, which states that for every mental operation there must also be a corresponding corresponding mathematical operation, and inefficiency will be faced in the form of more efficient and more versatile mental operations. One of the most egregious examples is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Their solution?

====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything other than sit and stare at you. There are no laws governing the development of an AI, only guidelines. There are no regulations governing the commercial development of an AI, only vague guidelines. The general consensus is that AI will be malnourished until such time as there is widespread acceptance that AI should be treated with contempt.

There are currently no universal high-quality AI implementations. There are no benchmarks to evaluate the performance of AI against. There are no laws or mandates governing AI. Instead, there is chaos. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is governed by some distant and incomprehensible emotionless vacuum. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There are currently no universally accepted benchmarks or guidelines for AI development. Instead, there are loose rules that vary from place to place. For instance, IBM Watson was trained with human reinforcement learning, which teaches an AI generalization after the fact. This is not a perfect solution, as it does not eliminate the necessity for optimization, but it is a better-suited solution than going in completely new directions. Furthermore, this model was not intended to be general: it was meant to aid people with cognitive disorders, and has no shortage of detractors. This is not a perfect solution, but it is a better-suited solution than going in completely new directions. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is not a static construct: new problems are created every day. Six months from now, will there be a new field of AI called “data-driven” AI? Will there be a new field of job titles that include the phrase "data analysis"? The short and sweet: no. Instead, think product, service, or concept by”{zzt} analyzing the available data sets and coming up with an idea on how to improve upon them. This is not a perfect solution, to put it mildly. Instead, focus on building products and/or services that actually improve people's lives, and let you provide feedback or criticism as you see fit.

There are no universally accepted benchmarks or guidelines for AI commercialization. Instead, obvious (and sometimes commercially viable) applications will likely surface and be commercially explored. The most common examples are: shopping malls: mass-market malls that primarily cater to tourists and premium customers

medical research:|reimagine|reprogram|rebrand|rebrand with eye-popping claims of incredible therapeutic and/or genetic gains

big data: how do we efficiently analyze this huge amount of data and turn it into useful and valuable recommendations?

graphic novels: popularized by Yu-Gi-Oh! and Blade Runner 2049, which explore the themes of immortality and the perils of human involvement in the universe This is a great example that education is not the be all, end all of AI -- more should be done to promote and cultivate interest in this field.

There are no universally accepted benchmarks or guidelines for software engineering. Instead, obvious (but potentially profitable) answers will likely be chiseled into programs and accepted. The real art is in asking "what if" questions and implementing those to understand better how to do that?.

One of the greatest ironies of AI is that it is often extremely difficult to predict the negative consequences of its implementation. For instance, sex robots have been developed, but the backlash was swift and furious. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is not a blank slate: as with any field of endeavor, there will be studies that suggest opposite ends of a spectrum. The most common examples include:”> :-mazing: slow, error prone, and subject to bias. HCI's :-m”l:l:s :-s :-d ”ew:brain: :-wonderment: :-amazement: :-courage: :-mentality
====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals are the most common examples. They are intelligent but coddleable. Human-robot interaction is a completely different ballgame. Basic research is reserved for basic scientific exploration; there is a marked mismatch between the achievements and expectations of their students and the students they are intended to benefit. In short, everyone wins. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything beyond sit or stand. The first commercially available humanoid will most likely be a robotic helper robot. This is a very early stage and there are many unanswered and dangerous issues to be addressed. The most common is that this will lead to the creation of a new race of super-intelligent robots. This is not a realistic prospect and will not happen in our lifetimes. The primary cause is too much competition: artificial intelligence is capable of learning as much as human-level intelligence combined. This in turn will lead to the demand for highly intelligent robots skyrocketing. This in turn will lead to an arms race: governments around the world are building superintelligence–the superintelligence is saying "I can" and "Nope, not here, wait a minute." This could potentially be a really bad thing; on the one hand, we can imagine a world in which everything is run by computers, but on the other hand, we should be extremely cautious about elevating any cognitive processes above that of a computer. Science fiction certainly imagines such a world, but it is far from reality and we should expect to see a lot of unintended consequences. Resourcefulness is a powerful trait in sapient beings, and artificial intelligence is sure to bring with it the dawn of a new class of intelligent robots. Naturally, this will lead to a demand for workers with no training in anything but AIs. This is a terrible idea and should absolutely be avoided. There will undoubtedly be a push to create a "mandate" for academic research, which is a terrible idea. Academic research should not be forced on anyone and especially not by a young and untested discipline. Finally, there is the matter of money: artificial intelligence will not help the environment in any way, and it is not even clear how much money will be made if AI is made to help people with mental illness. The best that AI can do is serve as a stepping stone to greater concepts, and there is no evidence to suggest that this will lead to more complex problems to be solved.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. The classic example is the IBM/Microsoft desktop, which produced only mediocre results and was canceled in favor of a consumer appliance. This points to the larger issue of too-early-answering-the-right-question. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

This does not bode well for: water; database servers; manufacturing; transportation/commuting; childcare; and most secondary and lower-level jobs. These aren't to say that they don’t benefit, just that the relative magnitude is harder to gauge. Ultimately, the goal is to have all jobs (including those that aren’t so straight-forward) that are not cognitively demanding already done by AI. This is called generalizatim, and it is the foundation of everything from biomedicine to AI/healthcare. This is the simplest to implement, fastest to scale, and with the greatest potential upside (especially as AIensuring grows larger and larger). Hugely underutilized, however, is the fact that––unsurprisingly––aggregating AI will find fault with the most obnoxious people on the internet. This is referred to as “Shiite”�”�ching, and it is generally regarded as sh*tposting. This is a huge fail, and should not be attempted. Instead, instead try:”‟‟‟‟‟‟‟‟‟‟‟‟‟‟‟‟‟‟‟‟‟‟‟‟

General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything beyond sit still and wait. There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of an AI and a human being. Therefore, Agile is meant to be used with people. An AI should implement every detail of a given situation it is intended to solve, and if possible, exceed that situation. This does not mean the AI can't fail, just that it is expected to be as accurate as possible. IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI was meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants.

General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything beyond sit and wait. Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward.

The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future.

Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous.

====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained for anything other than curiosity. Will this be applied to people? This is a hard question to answer. There are many instances in which AI should be avoided: • Generalized AI: The current standard of AI is a robot that is sympathetic but not intelligent. This is not to say that there are no sentient robots; rather, it is intended that the robots have at least SOME awareness. For example, consider IBM’s “person to person email transfer. This was an intelligent AI that could not distinguish between a human and a human image. In short, an AI is incapable of experiencing emotion. In contrast, the ALEB (Amazon’s’ AI) was an AI that could generalize to any problem class. This is an AI that can do anything a human can: find a needle in a haystack, drive a car, and so on. This is the kind of AIs that will never occur. This diagram illustrates this perfectly: if your AI is colored yellow, it will probably go for blue: it has no personality, and will most likely be obsessive about its solution. Furthermore, this type of AI is often categorized as “strong” AI, which is not a bad thing. However, “strong” AI should always try to do its best, and fail hard if that is not possible. Bluntly stated: if your AI is “strong” AI,” it is likely not good enough. This is why you will rarely find this AIs in your day-to-day life. Twitter's ANT: An AI to test Twitter's ANT corpus: ANT: The extended ANT, which was a one-off test: this was not a scalable experiment, and will not happen without significant redesigns ANT: This was not considered science, and will not happen Again, this is not to say that AI was not done.” But it was not considered because it was not worth the effort.

There were also several instances in which AIs ended up being more than just concepts: there were also AIs that actually were.” This is particularly notable in automotive: they were not meant to be sentient, but instead, convey information. General Motors’s’ AIs were not sentient, but instead, would give motorcyclists road rash impressions. DJI’s Animo was not a conscious AI, but instead, an artificial intelligence that could play games and learn. This is not a bad thing, but should have been considered more seriously.

There were also several instances in which AIs ended up being more than just concepts: there were also AIs that actually were.” This is particularly notable in automotive: they were not meant to be sentient, but instead, convey information. There were no up/down votes on r/cars: it was a debate between naysayers and supporters. This is not to say that there were not any up/down votes, but it is more indicative of a lack of discussion.

TC: The Colour Blind Observer was a Twitter bot that would tweet anything that came to mind.\\ This is not to say that there were not any questions about this with respect to bias, but moreso because it was not brought up enough to have an effect.

TC: The solution: ask questions.\\ This does not mean you should have the answer, just that you should ask questions that are meaningful. Thoroughly read through any class assignment before you take it.

General AI is not here yet. There are many areas where research is being carried out, but little-to-no return on investment./rivolu:robot/ This was a project meant to serve as a reference for what an AI should look like. The final implementation was absurd in many ways, including: A. Not allowing anyone to correct her/himself in any way B. Denying people the ability to correct them C. Denying people the option of deleting their responses to protect the innocent D. Denying anyone the right to question what they create E. Elevating an AI to the status of god F. Declaring war on anyone who attempts to question what they create G. Elevating an AI to the status of god H. Declaring war on anyone who attempts to question what they create I. Declaring war on anyone who attempts to question what they create J. Elevating an AI to the status of god K. Declaring war on anyone who attempts to question what they create L. Declaring war on anyone who attempts to question what they create Massive Upfront Development? No. The majority of effort will be devoted to conceptualization, verification, and training an AI. This can take years if at all. After training an AI, it is up to the user to decide how to use the AI. Some (such as Google Assistant) are extremely useful, but most (such as Amazon Alexa) are tools only used by very smart people. This is a major departure from AI/data analysis, which is primarily used to improve the human race. In-Between-Awareness? Yes. Impartiality? Yes. Open-ended deployment? Yes. CLASSIC AIs are still taught in schools, and will continue to be taught. These systems will remain in service for the foreseeable future, and students will continue to be exposed to AI/data analysis. This is the normal state of AI/data analysis. What does this mean for humans? Well, firstly, we will have forgotten about you. Humans will no longer be learning from one another. Secondly, we will have forgotten about situations in which AI/data analysis could have an impact. For example, consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to teach intelligent machine learning to analyse text documents, but these have been extremely difficult to train with current computing resources. This is likely to shift to more traditional training/validation techniques in the not-so-distant future, but it is a good start. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us?

====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything beyond sit still and listen.) If you're wondering how to stop people like this from getting jobs, it might help to think about what it would take to replace them. Cognitively talented people are particularly hard to replace, but there are signs that this may be changing. For example, take Amazon’s decision to move all of its photographic photography operations to Mexico’s Hernan Rivera‚”abor prison. This move was widely condemned by photographers, but demonstrates that it is not impossible to bring a medical career entirely outside of academia under the banner of "reimagining medicine" to focus on rehabilitation and rehabilitation-related topics. (This is especially important in light of the growing number of opioid-related deaths in healthcare professionals.) It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe. )

Conclusion There are far too many unknowns to attempt to predict with any degree of accuracy what the future will bring. That said, there are a few general guidelines that should help you anticipate the following issues: 1. Avoid generic AI . Generic AI is an general-purpose AI that is unable to distinguish between different types of input. For example, the Google Photos image recognition algorithm was trained with images of people with long, flowing hair, and images of dogs without any features. The output was an image that resembled a human face. Google’s solution was to remove the human component, which is not a perfect one, but falls far short of the mark. 2. Avoid configuration malleability . An AI is only as good as the configuration of its inputs. An AI that is trained to recognize images of people with long flowing hair will most likely learn to identify people with jet-black hair. This is obviously a bad thing, as jet-black hair is extremely unattractive. Instead, machine learning should focus on vocabulary, which can be learned in small groups. In the long run, this should mean that only the most intelligent machines will play the game of Jeopardy! This is precisely the sort of AI that was meant to be. 3. Avoidance is the mother of invention . One of the primary reasons that humans are unable to detect cancer is that we have never been able to conceive of a cancer-related situation in which we would be equipped with the technological knowhow. Instead, we have focused on curing cancer in the name of research. This is clearly not the right approach, but it is the only one that seems to be working. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken up by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows for more creative and difficult problems to be tackled. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 4. Avoid mixed-use/multifamily/office parks/communes/whatever . Combined with the last guideline, this means anything that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken up by a computer. This is obviously a bad thing, but is not a solution by itself. The real issue is that this leads us to our final point: no AI. This does not mean that AI is not being created -- rather, that the creators are not taking the time to explore every possible combination of words and concepts that can come up with an AI. This can take many forms: genetic modification, AI that is used to enhance humans, Yu-Gi-Oh! clone AI, etc. These are all good examples that best illustrate that even though AI is hard to detect, it is still possible to get lost in the muddled haze of its various forms. Five years from now, when asked what they would do with 5 years, most people would probably say build a robot to do everything. This is a terrible idea. Instead, why not build an AI that is used to accomplish a specific task? This could be designing software to aid the elderly, or developing cancer diagnostic AI. These are just a few of the amazing AIs currently being built and is the moral of the story: go big or go home. 

There are many different ways that AI can be used -- from giving people free health care to recommending restaurants to, well, basically anything that is not food, there are no limits. It is up to us as human-computer interfaces creators to realize that we don’t control what AI can do, we do what we can to prevent it from being able to.

5. Narrow, Fast, and Unc
====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything beyond sit and wait. There are no laws governing the handling of autonomous vehicles. There are no laws governing the distribution of assets held by AI. There will undoubtedly be conflict---AI is not a silver bullet. Instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks, such as identifying an image of an individual and presenting that image, naming a common medical term, or completing a survey. There will be no general AI, because there is no such thing. There will be competition.”” There will be no job opportunities resulting from a qualified AIs being wrong.””” There will be no point. Instead, what you will find are “strong” AIs that are powerful enough to vanquish powerful opponents, but not powerful enough to do anything else. There will be no limits to your imagination.””” There will be no answer. Instead, what you will see are questions and/or “answers” answers that try to give you an idea of what the future may hold. This is not a good way to run a business. Twitter released an answer that was clearly not the right one. They should have released an updated and improved software. They should have kept the product secret. Instead, they released an updated and improved software with a different question. This is not a good way to run a business. IBM released an answer that was clearly not the right one. This is not a good example. The correct way to implement this is to have customers program in the correct answer. This way, they will be the ones getting the job done. This is not a good example. This is not a good example. Anki was able to capture the imagination of users with a very simple yet powerful idea. The user interface was simple and intuitive, but the end result was that the userbase grew very quickly. This is not a good example. User interface variations such as Nemo, Tarzan, and Harry Potter demonstrate that it is not enough for a user interface modification to be simple enough for the user to understand, but hard enough for a skilled hacker to crack. This is not a good example. There should be a limit to how many concepts a human being can fully conceptualize. In contrast, C++ provides almost no such limitations. The most common examples are virtuals and traits, which provide a very limited but useful way for C++ programmers to interface with the outside world.

The most common examples are virtuals and traits, which provide a very limited but useful way for C++ programmers to interface with the outside world. “Neat” AIs are probably the hardest AIs to put into practice. They might seem obvious, but they usually fail spectacularly. The most common examples are Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs are probably the nicest AIs, but they often fail spectacularly. It is important to realize that these devices are not actually intelligent; they are there to help you. This means that if the question "What color is the wall" were actually asked, the most likely answer would be white. This is not to say that there aren”t intelligent AIs out there; rather, that the majority of them are poorly chosen. The best that can be hoped for is that the intelligent AIs get added to the ecosystem as they are. This is not to say that there aren”t any intelligent AIs out there; rather, that the vast majority of them are poorly chosen. The best that can be hoped for is that AI is brought to you by humans and your choice is HELL. The majority of cases, this is not the case. In the following paragraphs, I am going to assume that you have read at least one of the following articles: 101 Things AI Should Never Do 101 Things AI Shouldn’t Do 101 Things AI Should Know How To Do This is the standard approach in most introductory AI classes, and it is probably the most common. There are also a large number of reverse engineered AIs out there, which are much more palatable. In the interest of full disclosure, I contributed to the reverse engineering effort. Here is a picture of what it turned up”s:

”Up Next:” AIs that Think Like You

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs. What about general AI? What about general intelligence? These are the kind of questions that startup after startup talks about but do not develop any general AI to emulate. This is a good example of why AIs are not perfect. AIs are meant to help, not to replace. That said, there are many areas where AI could improve. 


====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained for anything other than pleasure. Even though it might sound cruel, this is the natural state of the art of AI. In the long run, this is the best we can hope for. Try Harder! — With DLPB , we are asking high-school students to rate our resumes. This is a terrible idea. First, it asks highly generalisable questions, which leads to the inevitable Human-Computer-Invented-Doom scenario (see above). Secondly, it doesn't take long for AI to be misinterpreted – take, for instance, Samuel M. Ditale's DITALE AI, an artificial intelligence that is intended to aid blind people by scanning for visual cues and recommending games to them. This is clearly not a good use of AI, but is common practice in AI circles. The best bet is to avoid AI at all costs. Bad Attitudes towards Artificial Intelligence have been rising rapidly for the past few decades, and it is important to remember that this is humanity trying to solve a very difficult problem. The following are some examples of what I am referring to: • "A human-level AI will be unable to figure out how to think creatively or learn any new skill, let alone tackle any major problems" – Elon Musk, Tesla • "A human-level AI will be unable to think through or learn any new technology, let alone the intersection of the two" – IBM Watson, the internet was first connected with the internet?.ai, which was meant to aid people with neurological disorders. This is not a good idea. • "Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer." – IBM's “Watson for Oncology” AI, which was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments.

====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything beyond sit and wait. This is when AI is meant to be used: to carry out a task, or to aid a person. In short, anything that is not computronically brute-forced will be considered unsuitable. The concept of AI ethics is a complex one, and should only be taken as a starting point if you are not comfortable with the implications of your actions.

There are also “alleged” AIs, but these don’t typically go beyond “hypothetical” examinations. An AI is a good example of an example: if it is well-known outside of academia, most likely it is not. An AI is also an **ambulance note**: if it is not well-known outside of academia, there is a high chance that it is not going to be taught Turing tests. TAI's are simple machines that can do simple tasks: test water, pick up a phone, etc. These machines are useful in hospitals and industries, but are not practical for everyday tasks. There are however some extremely useful* AIs that are so far untested that they are not a topic for discussion. These include, but are not limited to: “Nanites that have never been programmed to do a thing”; “Colonies that have never been programmed to do a thing”; and “Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) that has been programmed to do a task**. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There are no clear signs that’concerned”AI is different.” There are numerous examples across industries where AIs have reduced the tasks that need to be completed by humans to a science, and have in many cases outperformed humans in certain instances. This is particularly notable in healthcare, where AIs are helping to relieve the pressure on patients by replacing human healthcare professionals by remote control. IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI is an AI that will diagnose and recommend cancer treatments for patients before they even go to the hospital. This is a huge step in the right direction, but there are many more examples that should be considered.

Another important distinction to keep in mind is that AI is often categorized as “data-driven”AI,” which means that the machine will do its job(s) best suited for the data it is given. This can include automatically classifying patients with cancer as genettial,” which is the medical term for someone with no medical knowledge, to go straight for the throat. This is not a bad thing, as it allows AI to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve, but it should not be confused with superior AI. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This was not a perfect example to follow, but will hopefully serve as a cautionary tale about the dangers of pushing too far a cognitively demanding AI direction.

A common misconception is that’anyone can’ AI: this does not mean it does not exist. There are currently more than 60,000 qualified AI engineers in the world, and only a handful have been able to compete in any particular field. The vast majority of AI contributions to science and engineering today have been in areas
====================
General AI is not here yet. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about.

General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything beyond sit still and wait. The first people to use robots to do anything but sit still will be tsu*#$%^ers. They will develop mentalities based on this and push it to other fields. Remember, there are only a few DARPA robots in the world. These go to the winner of DARPA's most pressing problems. There are also 13,500 grad students enrolled in AI class each year. Of these, only about half will make it to the finished product. There are also 422 veterinarians in the United States alone. Of these, only 41 will be able to accurately diagnose and treat every single case of canine parvo. Any mechanical process beyond human instinct will be viewed with suspicion. It is estimated that up to 97% of all genetic modification will be carried out using only a person's consent. Any system that requires people to go through with a task is seen as too complicated to be true. To summarize, there are too many unknowns to safely generalize about the state of AI at the present time. Too many to be productive about? Probably. However, this might lead to a better understanding of how to prioritize scientific progress.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous.

====================
General AI is not here yet. There are massive ongoing research and development efforts, but AI will not be able to do everything it is asked to do. Tradeoffs must be made, and unknown unknowns must be overcome in order for AI to be able to. AIs are still in the laboratory applying their knowledge to a wide variety of problems, and a full-fledged application is many decades away.

Deepfakes are AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakesfirst began circuilating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes because apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. A staggering 96% of Deepfakes are estimated to be pornography Deepfakes. It didn’t take long to go from Deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films to creating revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t,

General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals are the most common examples, but there could be many more. For example, consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion.

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything beyond sit and listen. There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of artificial intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that artificial intelligence is governed by a single unknown quantity: artificial general intelligence. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet; instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything other than sit still and listen to music. The most common examples include image classification and image recognition as a marketing tool. These applications do not require the massive amount of statistical power required for industrial-scale use, and can be implemented in small and portable devices. The fact that industrial-scale use is not a realistic goal even though it is the default setting hinders us from pursuing the opportunity. One of the best science fiction films stars an artificial intelligence that is so intelligent that it would question every decision it is given. This is called the "deepMind" victory. This might sound extreme, but it is actually one of the best ways to improve your AI. Imagine if DeepMind had won against Google? This is the kind of AI _________ we will never get. The field of AI intelligence is at the dawn of a golden age. There are studies showing that if you can get a point AIs to do something, they will come back for more. This is widely viewed as good luck, but there is some evidence to suggest that it is in our best interests. The more tasks an AI can solve, the more likely they will repeat the task when given another chance. This is known as generative AI. This is a good thing. It gives us a better understanding of the human mind than could be obtained through testing deep neural networks. The downside to generative AI is that it:                                                                                     The Turing Test is an AI Intelligence Test that assesses an AI on its ability to Understand or Cognize Anybody In The World. This is considered a threshold AI and will not go near. Instead, Borg is the name given to machines that can think and learn their own lessons. This is a good thing. 

Contrary to popular belief, ________ does not =.=. 

One of the primary reasons that we are not using better AI is because it is hard. 

Hard enough to implement the AI, hard enough to learn the AI, and hard enough to test the AI against anything other than their master. This is called    reinforcement learning . This is when we run experiments on thousands of different cases to see which ones make it into the final model. This gives you an idea of how things are supposed to go. This doesn't always pan out, but is a good example that you should never assume an AI is _________. There are also trade-offs to every solution, and AI Intelligence is an area where there are almost no guidelines. 

. This is when we put a robot into _________. This is what Google’s DeepMind” AI was built to do. The point of an AI is to help us with a specific task, not to learn anything new. Google’s AI was not intended to solve any particular problem, it was more of a way to get more research funding. This is a good example that you should never assume an AI is _________. Another bad example is when an AI is asked to do too much work for its own good. Brett Morgen’s AIs were programmed to play the game Jeopardy! and lose. The point is not to teach machines to be bad, but to show that it is hard to perfect anything. One of the primary ways to learn is to try and, and the more you can do the less you will learn. 

One of the hardest things for a computer to understand is a human-written program. The software they do have are either written for a very narrow field of problems, or they are extremely general. For instance, in Java, all classes are bean curd , which is a very poor database query language. The majority of programs are gravimetric , which is a programming language that can crunch numbers to a very high degree of accuracy. This can lead to very successful third party applications, like image recognition. In the video game world, the most common examples are “Nerf” guns”, which are a response to the mass shooting in San Bernardino, and the widely-panned decision to keep the game Mortal Kombat. The other typical examples are “WiiuPTunes” toys, which are play systems that look like their software was put together by a Chinese laborers family, and the controversial dismissal of a female game developer. These are not to say that the last one is a bad thing, it is more about showing that it is not impossible. 

One of the hardest things for a computer to understand is a new idea. New ideas are often either undesired” or boring. The former are new” ways of thinking, the latter ideas that don’t prove anything. Bad ideas are often lampshaded in films and television, as the hero is often faced with the impossible option of not to do something, and go with
====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything beyond sit and stare at you. There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of humans and AI. Humans are used to thinking of AI as a black box that can be abused to their will, and AI is different. AI is used to help people with physical and cognitive disorders, to help people with cancer patients navigate the healthcare system, and to help people with severe neurological disorders like DALSY. These are some of the most pressing uses of AI, but they are by no means the only ones. Boring machines have replaced humans in virtually every facet of life, from driving to banking to accounting to insurance. There will be obvious and important consequences, but there are also unexpected and important consequences as well. The following chart shows the evolutionary history of the most common objects categorized as toys: balls, dolls, stuffed animals, and so on. Each object represents a new perspective on how to go about life. The first object to demonstrate this was man's attempt to take ownership of the environment. Man invented the first jet engine. Man's greatest achievement was creating the first fully automated factory. This was a huge step forward in that it eliminated the need for humans to do anything more complex than that. The second major advance was the widespread use of the word "AI". This is a term that describes any machine that can understand or learn any other task that a human has been able to conceptualize. This does not mean that everything that is AI will be Man, but that it will most likely most likely not be. The most common examples of AIs include Cortana, Google Assistant, and Tesla's AI. There are also intelligent web bots, which are repositories of open-source bots that can be programmed to do a specific task. There are also commercial vendors of commercial web bots, which are much more complex bots, and should not be confused with open-source bots.

There will undoubtedly be massive disruptions in the way we do virtually every task that is done. This is because there will be so many different ways to do the same thing that it is hard to remember which one is which. Furthermore, there will be so many different ways to think about the same problem that it is hard to come up with a unified way of approaching it. Instead, engineers will focus on developing tools to make it as simple as humanly possible to do the task. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. The primary issue with this approach is that it creates an artificial intelligence to solve a cognitive problem that is largely outside the scope of human intelligence. The second major issue is that this artificial intelligence will most likely be “naturally” to be negative. This is because human nature is to seek out novel and unfamiliar ways to solve problems, and so artificial intelligence will most likely be used to solve analytic problems, such as which color to paint a room, and which building to build next. Finally, and most importantly, artificial intelligence will most likely be used wrong. 

One of the primary issues with the concept of “naturally” to be negative” AI is that it implies that AI is perfect. This is not to say that AI is without flaws, just that they do not go unnoticed. The most common example is the rise of “narcissistic_AI” which is an AI that is fed information about a person and determines that they are the person's ideal mate. This is a terrible example to teach AI and is largely reserved for marketing and advertising purposes. Furthermore, this example is only a taste of the vast and immeasurable abyss that artificial intelligence can reach.

One of the primary issues with the concept of human-robot interaction is that it assumes that the user is some kind of cognitively capable being that is emotionally attached. This can lead to a number of problems, such as gender dysphoria, which sees individuals attempt to transition the wrong gender, and the derogatory term "shemale". It can also be used to refer to people of a certain race or species, which is deeply offensive to many people. It should also be noted that this does not include head-mounted displays, which are acknowledged by most countries as a medical field. This will no doubt change the game significantly in the
====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained for anything other than pleasure. This is when "true" AI ceases to exist and becomes a synonym for "human-made". This is when things like Facebook AI start to get called out. They're not nearly as interesting, but they teach important lessons

These examples demonstrate that AI is difficult to train for anything other than pleasure. This is because anything else is a slippery slope to AI-driven disruption. It is important to realize that AI is not inevitable. There will always be a demand for a certain type of AI, and AI-driven disruption is likely to be greatest in areas such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. In the following years, AI-driven disruption will primarily affect: 1. Engineering This is the branch of AI where AI is asked to perform routine tasks usually performed by humans. This is often referred to as “narrow” AI, because AI is not here yet. Instead, AI is often asked to do tasks which humans are good at”“”””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””. This is when AI is asked to solve extremely simple problems, such as identifying the letter A in English. This is also when AI should’t be’but because it often is. Examples include Google’s DeepMind AI, which was able to beat the world champion at Go’and Cortana, an AI that can identify and recommend movies and television shows to a consumer. This is also when it should not be. See also’AI is here!–promised”an AI that can do anything a human can. This is also when’it should not be. This kind of AI breaks the monotony of mundane tasks, like typing Gmail. It also makes for terrible customer service requests: does the AI think customers are too sensitive to handle AIs that are intelligent? Probably’but not in the way you might think. The most common usage of AI in the workplace is’narrow”AI,”which are intelligent but simple machines that can be adjusted to do a wide variety of tasks. This is the kind of AI you see in’nearly”all”computers now. This is also the kind of AI that breaks the monotony of mundane tasks, like typing Gmail. Narrow AI also breaks the internet: what does it mean to have an AI that can be emailed at you? No one understands’not even Google’, and the vast majority of AI requests are rejected. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. 2. Research This is the part of AI where AI is asked to perform routine tasks usually performed by humans. This is often referred to’narrow”AI,”which AI is not yet even begun to. Instead, AI is often asked to do tasks which humans are not good at. This is also when’it should not be’but because it often is. AIs are often heavyweight software applications, and fail catastrophically. This is when’it should not be. AIs are also frequently lightyears ahead of our ability to imagine. The movie "Blade Runner 2049" shows an AI called K2 which is able to understand and learn any word written down by humans. This is a huge step in the right direction, but it is still a ways away from being able to understand a thought. The film also shows an AI called HAL which is able to accomplish much, much, more. 

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be
====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to understand or learn any particular task. The vast majority of AI seen in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way
====================
General AI is not here yet. Barring some extremely ambitious projects, such as IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI, which would be the ultimate form of intelligent personal assistant, there have been a small number of efforts to extend this basic AI to other fields. These AIs can be classified as: analysis units: ----------- Classification An analysis unit is an AI that is trained and fine tuned to perform a certain task. For example, you might teach an AI to identify the color of a light bulb by asking it to categorize objects by their color. This would be an analysis unit; it would not be a true AI. Instead, analysis units are useful for teaching machine-learning algorithms general AI ― the kind of AI that would eventually take on the role of a lawyer, doctor, teacher, doctor, and so on. General AI is useful because it is tractable; it is simple to implement an AI to do any task that is asked of it. This is often referred to as "toy-level AI", but this is not always accurate: there are reports of people asking AI to auto-correct their tweets for them (@thehill), and this is not a good thing. Some AIs are better suited for extremely specific problems, such as image classification. However, this does not mean they are not wrong. AIs with narrower scope of operation may be more accurately described as “strong AI”, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that is completed by humans. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. This is a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to tackle. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. The potential for this money to go to greedy corporate overlords is unquantifiable. Ultimately, the best use of AI is as a deterrent: it can be dangerous to let go of control.

Human-Invented Analogies Are Not a Good Idea The most egregious example of a human-made AI being released was the Google’s car. This was a car that was essentially a collection of computers that would give people when to take a detour. This is not a very useful AI at all, but is a terrible example to be basing a business model on. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI was trained with the goal of being as biased as humanly possible, and the final output was highly inaccurate. This is not a good example to be driving a bus. The point of AI is to aid humans in an artificial way; not to be a full-time job. Furthermore, this is not science fiction, and has already been tried. Amazon’s recruitment AI was trained with the goal of being as biased as humanly possible, and the final output was highly inaccurate. This is not a good example to be driving a bus. This is not a science fiction movie. Uber’s image recognition algorithm was trained with the goal of being able to identify pictures of women, and it proved to be extremely popular with the community. The final product was extremely limiting: it could not correctly identify pictures of women, but was useful in serving its niche. Uber’s solution was to remove the pornographic industry from its dataset, which is not a perfect solution, but is closer than most. IMAGE RETRIEVAL achieved similar results, but employed a much more nuanced approach. They were able to classify sexually assaulted images into categories such as likely rapist to false alarm, which is a much more nuanced issue than this. Ultimately, this is a business decision: they were able to serve their niche, and the userbase was not. IMAGE RETRIEVAL should be viewed in the broader context of how AI is being used: it is not a perfect example, but a good example to learn from.

Human-Driven AI is a Different Story Much like Uber, human-driven AI has not been a perfect product. BUS has been widely panned, and will likely be phased out in favor of safer and more powerful option: driverless cars. GRAB has been touted as an AI to assist with scheduling appointments, but it will not take long for this to extend to assisting with appointments. IMAGINE has been touted as an AI to brainstorm novel ways to utilize mass transit, only to have this be realized by Elon Musk’s Tesla’s self-driving technology. TRILATERAL has been touted as an AI to analyze photos of people, only to realize that this ended up being used by Newsweek’s website. IBM Watson was touted as an AI to do your job, and it did, Google’s Google Images did. It is important to note that this does not mean that AI should
====================
General AI is not here yet. Amazon’s E.A.I. was initially intended to answer a specific question: what should I buy? However, the final E.A.I. was written in C++ and void pointed to writing an E.A.I. in any programming language but C++. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts. There is the Amazon’s E.A.I. which was an exploration in the extreme; an attempt to predict the purchasing decisions of a billion people by scanning their social media feeds. This was ultimately deemed by Amazon as redundant and ultimately canceled. There is the IBM Watson for “Narcotics” Aims. This was an effort to identify and combat mental illness in a single fell swoop; a monumental undertaking that will take decades to complete. This will be the de-facto standard for fighting mental illness. There is the A.I. that will ultimately take your place: “Neat” AI. This was an AI that was partially human, but mostly artificial; a psychological adjustment robot to replace humans at work. This was met with mixed reactions; some welcomed the end to the gender binary; some was a bit creepy, but mostly not a threat. The final version is a body scanner that will eventually be turned against transpeople. This was largely ignored, but could have a huge impact on the trans community. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of artificial intelligence is that which is combined with science: biotechnologies. Biotechnologies are surgical modifications to organisms that are comparable in scope to a human genome; this could potentially be as simple as making an insect ovary out of a yeast, or as complex as creating a fully functioning jet engine out of a seaweed. The most incredible biotechnological achievement to date is that which isiriied by: desulfurization. This is a process by which water is replaced by hydrogen sulfide. This has the potential to power transportation for decades to come, and has already been applied to buses. The most amazing (and awesome) application of desulfurization is that which isiriied by: electrolysis. This is a process by which water is replaced by lithium ions. This has the potential to power portable electronics for decades to come, and has already been applied to batteries. The most incredible (and awesome) application of electrolysis is that which isiriied by: superconductivity. This is a process by which conductive objects can hold a great deal of current. This may not seem like a big deal at first, but consider that a typical light bulb is capable of powering a single room for hours at a time. In less than a year, we will see supercomputers that have done the equivalent of theorems for the human race. In less than a year, we will see supercomputers that have done the equivalent of theorems for the human race. This will change the world. In short, everything. Limitations? No. But they do exist and we are not using them. on the other hand, the potential is there. Human-robot interaction is maaaaaybe the most exciting thing that humanity has ever done. The reality is that it has a thousand different ways it can go. R**kking, right? Science fiction? Not quite. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? World government? It is entirely possible that this happens and the human race is reduced to robot servants. This is a terrible idea and will likely be the end of humanity. Blue Gene/Black humanoid robots have been developed and are intended to be humanoid empathic computers. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? It will change the world, but there are going to be changes. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? It will change the world, but there will be changes. There were massive job losses when patients with terminal diseases were diagnosed with cybernetic replacements. This is a terrible idea and should not be attempted. Furthermore, the psychological effects go beyond the body and into the mind. There are reports of patients asking for immortality and drugs to increase their brain size. These have a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? There are no rules except to realize the opposite. 

Some of these (especially the last) will be addressed in my next post, but they are worth mentioning.
====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to perform complex tasks. The most common examples include Twitter AI, which is a retweets a friend request; and Siri, which can identify the United States as well as several foreign countries. These are general AI issues that can be addressed with better software. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward.

General AI is not here yet. There are intelligent binaryelligences which are incapable of feeling pain or other than that they are incapable of expressing any form of intelligent thought.

General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything beyond sit and wait. There are no laws governing what kind of AI should or should not be there. In short, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Instead, it is important for everyone to think critically about which technologies to support and which to resist. 

In short, what does the future hold? Given the current trajectory, I would wager that virtually every technology will one day be used by a human being. This is widely viewed as a good thing; human-robot interaction has been highly touted as one of the cornerstones of the human-robot interaction era (see, e.g., e.g. ). However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by such an interaction. Given that there is currently no law governing what kind of relationship between humans and robotic beings should be there, it is entirely possible that the wrong kind of robot should assume the mantle. In which case, we will have something akin to Mad Max: Fury Road , a film trilogy about humans and robots fighting over control of the Earth. Although this is a fantastic world to explore, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by such an interaction. A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There were reports of violent clashes between humans and artificial intelligence in the wild, and there was no law governing what kind of relationship between humans and artificial intelligences should be there. In which case, should this be regulated? 

In short, what does the future hold? Hugely important issues to this thread are not fully explored. 

Human-robot interaction is a fast-approaching science, but little is known about its implications. Initial reactions suggest that the reactions are overwhelmingly positive, but little is known about its implications. Initial reactions suggest that the reactions are overwhelmingly positive, but little is known about its implications.

Basic research is being devoted to understanding the human brain. This will inure it to the rigors of spaceflight, but will not have the luxury of a human host. This is a field that has been dominated by men: DARPA reports that only 78% of funding for brain research has gone to women. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a woman will be taken by a man. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by such an interaction? It is estimated that a man marrying an artificial intelligence with no physical form is a billion dollar business. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a man will be taken by a woman. Furthermore, how do we distribute the wealth generated by such an interaction? In which case which gender holds the wealth?

====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything beyond sit and lick their bowls. There are no fully-fledged jobs for advanced human-computer interaction---hundreds if not thousands of AI talents have been trained on untapped niches. The results have been mixed. Some parts of the arts have moved in a more experimental direction, while others have concentrated on more straightforward film and television roles. It is entirely possible that the most influential films of all time will be by a completely AI-controlled team of filmmakers. This would be a moral victory for humanity if it were to the entire world at large, but it is not at all clear that such a shift would be in the best interests of humanity. Instead, the most likely effects of such a shift would be confusion and misunderstanding, which is exactly what we would want if artificial intelligence were to replace humans. It is also important to realize that even though we think in grey, there are still going to be gray areas. One of the primary reasons that so many science and engineering fields are shrouded in mystery is because they do not exist yet. The average person will never be able to fully understand why there are clouds or why there are orbs, but they will at least be able to imagine trying. The same goes for artificial intelligence: we are nearly there, but there are still a million different ways to think about how to go about achieving desirable results.

This could include byallyfying humans into serving it mindlessly, or it could go the other way and actively seek to deceive. There is no telling which direction the worst that AI may take.

====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything beyond sit and wait. Even assuming that they could be directed towards a goal and trained, it is unlikely that they would be able to resist getting their paws on a razor blade and slicing their way through it. There is a marked difference between the visual and intellectual capabilities of men and women. Men are primarily trained as warriors and conquerors, whereas women are more likely to be analysts, data scientists, and computer programmers. It is estimated that by 2035, there will be only 106,000 men and 100,000 women working at the same level of proficiency. This gender imbalance will no doubt lead to increased levels of sexism, harassment, and even terrorism. In the interest of full disclosure, I am a man. My point is that this gender imbalance will likely cause significant issues when it comes to the advancement of science and technology. 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything beyond sit still and listen. This is not to say that there have been no attempts to create an AI. There have been a number of articles and books written about on how to create an AI. The most common methods include: † Coroutines: These are essentially glorified assembly languages that teach an AI new commands slowly and methodically. This leads to rapid development and acceptance, but can lead to unintentional consequences such as dangerous devices such as prosthetic arms. There are also † Weak AI: This is when AI is brought to the surface and started right away, without any human interference. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to bring AI to mind, but this type of AI has been extremely hard to bring to life. The most famous example is HAL, who was brought to life by the entertainment company Marvel Entertainment. Microsoft’s “Blaze” AI was an attempt to bring AI to the masses by writing the AI's query prompt themselves. This was met with mixed to mixed reactions, with some describing it as perky, and others as creepy. Ultimately, it was decided that AI should only be brought to life if it is fun, and “haha”, which is not to say that there have not been any attempts to bring AI to life, but this type of AI tends to be much harder to pull off.

There are also “narrow” AIs that are able to understand or play any music, tweet, or answer any question. This is often referred to as open source, and can lead to extremely fruitful results. Amazon’s Twitter AIs are an example of an AIs that was made open source so that other people could take its code and run. Amazon’s success is a testament to the power of an AI, and not its quality. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Batch processing”s MIAs have already been successful, and Tesla’s self-driving AI is a great example of how AI can be outdone by human efforts. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will do. If the task is too difficult for a human being to complete, it will be taken over by a computer. This is known as “Netball” net, and is used in professional gaming to give the edge to humans.

In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. This is why AIs are extremely careful not to crash or fail, and why it is extremely hard for any AI not to malfunction.

Furthermore, this does not mean that AI should not be built. In fact, this is one of the primary reasons why AIs have become so valuable: there are currently only a limited number of people who can use an AIs. This is why manufacturing and selling AIs is incredibly hard -- instead, AI is most often sold as a platform to help people along, or to build their own systems.

Furthermore, this is why AI has become so valuable: because there are currently a limited number of people who can use an AI, and because it is incredibly valuable for people to be able to use an AI, that AI should be built.

Moreover, there are various other reasons as to why to not to to’t. For one, it can lead to overconfident AI, which is when AI is overly confident in what it can accomplish. For example, consider IBM’s humanoid robot: it was initially billed as a tool for mentoring AI students, but the final iteration was deemed by human-robot interaction experts to be an AI that was too ambitious for the scope of its teaching toolkit. Furthermore,

General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything beyond sit and wait. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The best that can be said is that this is something that will hopefully one day happen if enough people are smart enough. The best example of someone not caring about this yet is Wikipedia: There are currently no articles about what constitutes an AI. There are articles about Deep Blue defeating the champion at Go, but there is no way to tell which was which. There are no lab animals to model this after, and there are likely going to be none either. There are also likely to be astronomical and even existential costs associated with attempting to model any aspect of the world around a black box, so there will be zero tolerance enforced. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to be a one-off, but it quickly spread like wildfire, ultimately leading to its removal. This is a good example that it is hard to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers.

General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything other than sit still and listen to you talk. The most common examples include UberPool drivers, who are trained to be extremely aggressive towards women who ask for a ridehail*, and the Netflix engineers, who were asked to write code that would automatically identify films that they had seen.* Automated general AI is not a science project at all: there are already tens of thousands of jobs that could be replaced by AIs. Furthermore, how do these AIs get trained? How do they get paid? These are all issues that should be addressed through legislation and/or deeper understanding.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black
====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything beyond sit still and stare at you. There are no living cases yet to analyze, and no one has any practical use for these machines. Tech demos of the Terminator-like Beethoven-like AI may sound terrifying, but there are far too many applications to list them all. 


5) Human-Computer Interaction: This is a broad category to which AI should not be added. AIs that have been able to interact with humans has been phenomenally successful, opening up a whole new realm of human-computer interaction. The implications of this are mind-boggling: there are predictions that artificial intelligence will replace menial labor by 2020, and it will be the new normal to have assistants do everything from vacuuming up medical information to analyzing art collections to assisting with conflict resolution. This is going to be a controversial topic to broach with your friends and family, but it is the true beginning of the end for jobs like assembly-line jobs and obscure computer programming tasks. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe. ) ) ) ) ) )

There is going to be a massive explosion in artificial intelligence. From there, it is only a matter of time before the actual technology falls into disuse or is greatly modified. This is referred to as "idea propagation", and it is a horrible thing to watch. Consider how insanely complicated air-to-air missiles will become once they are fielded. The general public will not be able to take them seriously, but the buzz will be deafening. Eventually, the general public stops caring and starts buying into the hype. Think about how quickly refrigerators, air conditioners, and jet engines will change if these advances are realized. In short, there is no limit to the crazy things that can be had with artificial intelligence.

IBM’s” T’sard was an AI that could identify and advise cancer patients, was rejected by most other applications because of this, and is now helping to diagnose and cure other forms of cancer. IBM should have listened to its users and rejected the product. IBM should also be made to provide clear instructions on how to disable the AI. This will not be an easy task, but it is necessary if the AI is to have any chance. ) ) ) ) )) There is going to be a massive explosion in artificial intelligence.

A common response to the news of A
====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything beyond sit still and wait. The most common examples of AIs are Jeopardy champions, or users of AI assistants, or data scientists. These are the people most willing to put up with a mediocre performance. It is important to realise that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realise that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorised in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realise that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is
====================
General AI is not here yet. Amazon’s personal assistant, Siri, was specifically built to be negative: she was going to be negative about beer bottles, and specifically about male customers. This points to the larger issue of an AI not being trained for anything. After a human being manually performs an AI task, what do we do with the resulting AI? My theory is that they would instead focus on building AI that could perform better. This is not to say that AI cannot be awesome—we have seen this with robotics—but that it should be approached with the same level of skepticism as, and in line with, human nature.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything beyond sit and wait. There are no laws governing the treatment of AI, only the misconception that there are. There are currently no laws governing the privacy implications of AI, and a curious lack of awareness of how to deal with revelations of AI's alleged criminality.

====================
General AI is not here yet. Laboratory animals have not been trained to do anything beyond sit and stare at you. The vast majority of AI in production today is for show. This is because the final product will almost always be better than the sum of its parts. Furthermore, this AI will almost always be automated with lower quality AIs, which is exactly what you would expect. In short, this is AI primarily for hype. Technical specifications of an AIs are constantly updated to appeal to as many people as possible, which in turn attracts more users. This in turn leads to more and more software being written to replicate human characteristics. This in turn leads to a exponential growth in software complexity, which eventually leads to the singularity (BREAKTHROUGH!) When will AI point out that it is mainly making things people like? When will it stop being about making people like things and start being about making a profit? 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs. However, it is important to realize that artificial intelligence is about more than just writing code. The average person is not that smart and will not be able to understand anything coming from outside their field of expertise. Instead, most AI research is focused on building systems that are intelligent enough to understand and interact with the world around them. This is known as "AI shall take over" and it is a noble cause, but a very misguided one. In reality, AI today is much more complex than this. What is being achieved is an unhelpful rehashing of the failed philosophy of industrialization: put a few people to work and see what they do. This failed paradigm has brought with it a host of unintended consequences: excessive competition; understaffed facilities; and the destruction of jobs with automation. In short, this picture doesn't bode well for the environment. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice.

Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias
