Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial labor. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

Furthermore, why do we have to have this? Why do we have to work 60-hour weeks? Suck it, 80-hour weeks. This will save us tons of money in the long run. Instead, focus on developing amazing products that will revolutionize our lives. Google Photos, Amazon Alexa, and Apple Home are just a few of the products that have already come out of Google and are aggressively developed to please fans of their products. Invest in research and development. Create a group of talented engineers and ask them to create a million products a day. This will create a demand for their products and eventually lead to a chip design company coming out with a product every month. This will generate millions of dollars in revenue for them and the company should be allowed to. This should also be the rule for software patents. If a product has a useful feature, then by all means implement it. However, if that feature is abused, then fix the issue. This doesn’t apply to semiconductors, but it should be easy to see how this principle can apply to most areas of computing. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail.

This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments.

Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones.

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

· Increased unemployment. Humans are not computers. Therefore, we should not attempt to model human behavior. Instead, focus on designing machines that can do the job very well. The result? An inflation-adjusted unemployment rate of just 0.000001%. This is an extremely low rate of unemployment, and is in keeping with evolutionary biology.

Rapidly improving medical technology is bound to have implications beyond the lab. Dealing with terminally ill patients has been extremely difficult; it is far too early to tell what types of therapies might be created. A revolutionary new class of medical robots is developing every day. Are they safe? Should we allow this? Should we enforce a higher standard of medical care?

There are also practical issues that come up along the way. Most notably, the issue of employee/employer/hireee duality. Most businesses today are categorically against it. How do we ensure that no one in the company becomes employee X and that nobody at work becomes employee Y? This is arguably the hardest issue to tackle, but could have the biggest impact on the world of work in the next 5 to 10 years.

Ultimately, the question of what to do with the extremely talented humans that we remove from the equation will ultimately be decided by an independent robotic majority. This will not be a simple matter to navigate, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed
====================
Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial labor. How do we ensure that no one goes to work tomorrow and starts a company the following year? What do we do with the people who lose their jobs? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving everyone in the world free education. This is a good idea within the framework of providing for the common good. However, it does not go far enough. A universal basic income would not only give every person in the world access to quality education, it would also allow for more nuanced issues to be addressed. For example, how do we ensure that everyone has access to healthcare? This is an entirely different ballgame. A basic income is simply a check made to every adult in the world to ensure that they have access to healthcare. This is a much more nuanced matter altogether, and I do not have the luxury of brokering this issue until AI is a reality. 

Within the context of AI, there is the misconception that "good" AI leads to "great" AI. This is most apparent in the creation of Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs are not designed to be exact imitators; instead, what they have created are metaphors to help ease the cognitive load of the user. In short, they are answers to commonly asked questions. This is not to say that these AIs have not been successful; they have, and they have done so while also serving a very specific and extremely important clientele: healthcare. The fact that they have not been able to disrupt existing business models does not mean they have not succeeded.

It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe. This does not mean that there has not been no progress. There has been a marked increase in funding for research into AI; this can be best summarized by the fact that AI is no longer a field to be terrified of. Instead, it is time to get used to the idea that this technology is on the verge of revolutionizing our lives. Just take a look at what is currently running on in stores and grocery stores: it is clear that this is an entertainment product made to entertain, not as a platform for human advancement. Furthermore, this should not be a surprise; this is what Hollywood does. They flash the wanest intentions possible, and then force the public to sit through their propaganda. Carl Sagan famously said, "If you can think of a use for an idea, we will call it;" and I wholeheartedly agree. If you can't think of a way to apply an idea, don't ask. 

In the spirit of clarity, I must admit that I have failed you. There are, unfortunately, bound to be cases where AIs are wrong. This does not mean that there have been no consequences to this decision; in fact, there have been a plethora of examples where AIs have made people millions of dollars. The most egregious example of this came with the introduction of the ADAM, which was an artificial intelligence for the automotive industry which was estimated to have generated between $100 and $250 million. This is a terrible example to be basing your business model off, and I deeply apologize to anyone who has to pay to have one taken down. 

There are also known issues with AĨs application that do not get covered by the media. For example, take the following example: what if instead of offering to give you a massage, it offered to drive you to your destination? This is a ridiculous example to be thinking about, but illustrates that AI is not yet sophisticated enough to pull this off. Furthermore, why would a human man up with an AI? It doesn?Ât take much mental stimulation to realize that this will be the final AI. 

There are also practical issues that do not get explored in film, literature, or in-person examples. Consider the following films: Blade Runner 2049, Robin, and Sherlock. These films show science fiction taking place in the not too distant future. The majority of the audience is not even in the room to see what happens in these films, but the message is clear: we do not yet have fully interactive artificial intelligence, and we are not going to be able to afford to stop now. There are going to be too many issues and not enough solutions. If you work in technology, what do you think of the following examples? 

There are also cultural effects that do not get explored in film, literature, or in-person examples. Consider the following films: Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Avengers: Age of Ultron, and Iron Man 3. These films show a young Han Solo going up against an army of faceless, emotionless AI. This is a great example that you don?t need to be an artist to realize that an AI will be used. Furthermore, how do you train an AI? There are going to be too many answers and not enough answers. If you work with humans

Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial labor. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers
====================
Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial labor. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics. Will this be taught as a fun STEM subject in schools? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward.

Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. Boring/nonscientific AI is a huge part of the current biomedical research community, but AIs are everywhere. What do we do with the de-humanized AIs? The primary use of AI is in education. There are obvious educational and training uses, but also in manufacturing (e.g., don’t ask, don’t tell), and AI is used to detect mindlessly intelligent machines. There are also a million other applications, but these are mostly theories and not implementations.

One of the primary issues is that AIs will be used in harm’s way. The infamous IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI was an AI that was intended to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. The lesson? Don’t try this at home. AIs will not stop being abused, but will instead be used in the service of maximum disruption. The final problem with AIs is that they are inherently super inefficient. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. The initial implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. The advice in the final implementation was to err on the side of caution and suggest appropriate cancer treatment advice. The lesson? If you’re thinking of tackling cancer, focus on finding a patient with no symptoms, and don’t bother trying to diagnose or cure them. The important thing to realize is that artificial intelligence is not perfect. AIs have already begun to struggle with difficult problems, and will continue to struggle as we progress. The real threat to humanity does not come from artificial intelligence, but from humans. From music to video games to automobiles, humans are now largely in control of the process. This means that decisions about how to distribute the wealth will be left up to humans. This is a terrible outcome, but one that has not occurred to anyone who has ever held a job. Any decision made by a human on an automated process will be echoed in a computer, and will likely be a worse one. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise. It is only a matter of time before it takes over the human race. That will be a very, very, very long process. —Nvidia’s’ Carl Icahn,””"What do we do with the guys? They are killers. They are nerds. They will learn."” Carl is referring to the menial labor jobs such as carpenters, and there is no doubt that they are taking over. What are the implications for society? Well, we will most likely need to find new ways to distribute the wealth. The first signs are already showing: Alibaba’s (shenz.com) acquisition of Wipster was touted as a way to make college education cheaper, but in all likelihood will be used to sell cheap access to education.

Amoris Arcus is a term for a computer program that is half man, half machine. Amoris were popular during the late 20th century, but due to their extremely high complexity, latency, and cost, they have since fallen out of favor. The main issue with Amoris is that they are incredibly hard to implement correctly. The final implementation of Facebook was estimated to take Robotic Intelligence on a pell-mell quest for knowledge as it went through the system, eventually landing on one of their own. This is not a good sign for the future of AI, as AI needs humans to perform stereotypical AI tasks. The most extreme example of an AIs failing is Google Photos, a photo recognition algorithm that could have identified and saved the life of Kurt Cochran. Artificial Intelligence should be relabeled so that people understand what it is and what it does.

Amoris are not the only issue with AI. Autonomous vehicles will almost certainly bring with it questions about privacy and liability. This is a field that has been very difficult to regulate, but that will surely be lab-grown if efforts to do so go forward. The most egregious example of this came with Facebook, which allowed friends to recommend things to read. The question here is that it was a friend suggest, and not meant to be read as such. The point is that it was a friend suggest, and not meant to be read as such. The best that can be hoped for is that AI is taught correctly, but not how to use this to its advantage. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI was made to be gender neutral: they came up with " don’t ask, don’t tell, but instead gender-swapped it to convey that they didn’t want to hire people with a certain gender name. This was clearly not the intent, but showed that AI is not above bumbling around with the gender binary. 

One of the primary issues with AI is that it is hard to relay these ideas to engineers/scientists/etc. This is not to say that AI has not been used for bad things; the Tesla’s AI was accused of being too optimistic about the car's performance, and the correct rate of return on an AI is to maximize the variance – the more variables there are, the more options there are to consider, which leads to increased complexity. This could prove detrimental in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Ultimately, though, this is a matter of perception – if an AI is able to understand you, they will. This does not mean they will do anything useful with the information, just that it will beets no one else.

There are also practical issues with AI-led solutions. Most notably, the female employee problem. This is particularly acute in healthcare, where it is difficult to anticipate which candidates willet good ideas with a sexist culture. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took one day for the world to see that it was not helping anyone. The same can be said of Google’s DeepMind AI: it was meant to play Go, and in less than an hour it was dissecting chess positions to determine which ones to play. The problem with this is that chess is a predominantly male

Consensus Technology is Déjà vu all over again. Apple’s iWork suite was designed to make it super-simple to make electronic copies of published articles. Within a day or two, the code was public, and Apple lost money on every laptop it sold. The same thing will not be true with software. Most software will not be redesigned to take into account the widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles. Instead, the emphasis will be on software engineering and robotics -- bring on the AI. Apple’s lesson should be obvious: do away with the extrinsic rewards and focus on the internal rewards. Most importantly, learn from my mistakes. Over and over again, media outlets have reported on the suffering caused by automated and robotic labor, but have largely failed to report on the problem of unintended consequences. Uber’s driver in Arizona was fired because he was gay. This is an extreme example, but serves as a good example that unintended consequences can be extremely difficult to control. In the following weeks and months, many companies will release consumer-facing products and sell them to us, only to discover that their products were designed to be used by people with no formal education. The first signs are likely to be confusion and distress. Businesses that advertise that they are offering educational programs will likely lose out. On the plus side, anyone can get a job designing software and sell it, which is a much healthier career choice than designing complicated robots to perform everyday tasks. 

Unintended Consequences One of the primary issues is that no one will be able to predict every eventuality. A revolutionary medical technique is developed and immediately deployed by a small number of doctors. The idea is that by publishing their results in a journal, the public will be able to more easily manage patients with no previous medical training. This could prove to be a godsend in the long run, as it will prove that no one has to spend their life working at it. A completely unrelated but equally revolutionary medical idea is developed and immediately deployed by the general public. The initial studies show that it is superior to existing methods, and quickly gains in popularity. The first to adopt it are doctors. They immediately begin treating everyone as if they were an advanceable medical technology, which is a huge win for the patient. The final layer of protection is to put this to use in the military, where it will prove to be incredibly useful. The initial trials are inconclusive, but should quickly grow into a real-world application. The final layer of protection is to put this to use in the military, where it will prove to be incredibly useful. This is by no means a complete list, but it serves as a good example. There are many different ways in which a technology can be misused. For example, sex robots were marketed as male companionship, but soon turned out to be robot girlfriends. The initial response was overwhelmingly negative, but could teach the world to not to ask female customers about their schedules. Similarly, sex robots could prove to be enormously disruptive in the medical field, but quickly gain in popularity after being released into the wild. The first to market are likely to be sued, but is that to my taste? Probably not. The most common types of misuse are control experiments, which are experiments which do not yield desired results, and RACism, in which a creature is intentionally bred to be male. This is not to say that no man in a woman's body case ever gets done, but it does show that there are other ways.

This could prove to be a godsend in the long run, as it will prove that no one has to spend their life working at it. Any lab worth their salt will ask for your medical card number. This is a good example that should absolutely be followed. Medical school admissions should be a merit-based process, with preference given to candidates who have published tolkills. Any system in which a student does not get in because they have a M.D. degree will not be a system isethis. Any system that gives preference to publications by professors with PhDs will beioaced.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. IBM’s humanoid robot, named Watson, was intended to be a compliment to the oral and written communication required of human-robot interaction. However, this showed no signs of completing the interaction gap it was meant to fill. Bionic arm/hand/fingernail/car/robot hybridization is a field that has been gaining momentum, but is currently a field that has no oversight. Some BIs are creepy, but they are mostly minuscule steps in the right direction. R&D on autonomous weapons is marred by inconclusive results, and test vehicles have shown no signs of stopping. The most terrifying (and awesome) BIs are those that destroy people, animals, or otherwise share the world with humans. There are currently no guarantees that BIs will not be used in a way that is not awesome, but this field is currently a field that has no oversight. Widespread adoption of intelligent machines is against humanity’s best interests. The majority of human-computer interaction volumes are being held by artificial intelligence that is useful in very specific niches such as ergonomics, sensory/memory enhancement, and therapy. Widespread adoption of intelligent machines is against humanity’s best interests. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 


One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will make us into robots. How do we reconcile this with the idea that we should be working to create a world in which there are no jobs and everyone has one? This is a tough question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been growing exponentially but has barely begun to explore the full range of implications. From surgical robots to patient-monitoring robots, there is a field that has no oversight and is being bled to make way for artificial intelligence.

AI will not be perfect. The more sensors and computers that are combined, the more accurate and powerful each will be. Furthermore, this will increase the risk of dangerous artificial intelligence taking over. This is why it is important to train for and test against artificial intelligence with as few instances of failure as possible.

Furthermore, this will increase the risk of dangerous artificial intelligence taking over. This is why it is important to train for and test against AI with as few instances of failure as possible. Bad AIs have been discovered and are rapidly advancing. This is why it is important to test and deploy defenses in advance.

Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs. In the future, will it be the opposite? AI is not a superintelligence; it is an application of advanced mathematics to solve very specific problems. This is when a small, general AI becomes powerful enough to conquer the human race. The Turing Test is no longer necessary: any AI that can program a picture of a room and answer a simple question is considered to be intelligent. This will not just apply to hospitals and clinics, but any field where AI can be used. Every company in the world is developing AI to perform tasks for humans, and we are going to be the world's biggest consumers of AI? This is a very big "I don?t know" to answer. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic.

An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution?

Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial labor. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics. Should we accept the new normal and adjust? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns.

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics. Should we accept the new normal and adjust the job requirements? This will shift the job demand to software engineering and robotics. Should this shift go by smoothly and without incident? This is a difficult question to answer, but should absolutely be dealt with.

Another issue is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics. Should we accept the new normal and adjust the job requirements? This will shift the job demand to software engineering and robotics. Should this shift go by smoothly and without incident? This is a difficult question to answer, but should absolutely be dealt with with a high probability. Yes. In order to maintain the current employment situation, we must fix the human population. Any artificial intelligence not programmed for human consumption will be replaced by AI. This is a hard pill to swallow, but if left unaddressed, AI will most likely bring destruction.*

Any artificial intelligence not programmed for human consumption will be replaced by AI. This is a hard pill to swallow, but if left unaddressed, AI will most likely bring destruction.* AIs are not perfect. They do not answer all questions, and they are not perfect either. Missteps and crashes can be extremely hard to diagnose, and even catastrophic failure can be extremely hard to prevent. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to primarily engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard to anticipate how AI can be misused.

*Contrary to popular belief, human-robot interaction is not a panacea. There are too many variables to fully analyze this to any great degree, but it is safe to say that it does not crop up in abundance.

Beware the after-sales service. This is a term that describes companies that offer services and products solely for the purpose of collecting revenue. These services often have the distinct advantage of being free, but the burden of maintaining the relationship often falls on the customer. In many cases, this is not a bad thing; after all, what is the point of paying for a service if you don’t get anything in return? However, there are also companies that attempt to capitalize on consumer dissatisfaction by offering services and products that are wholly unhelpful. Tomboy swimsuit enhancement? Check. Medical diagnostics that only diagnose breast and cervical cancer? Check. AIs that are trained to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic? Check. Tech support that is limited to advising consumers how to install their preferred software? Nada. Zero. The internet has a way of amassing bad will, and it is best to learn from its mistakes.

After all, is there not a cut-off point at which a customer will not return the favour? Similarly, is there not a cost to attempting to predict the future? The answer to the first question is no, but the second is not a surprise. Some problems are too hard to hope to model, and most problems do not add up. Uber’s self-driving AI was billed as being able to drive an Uber without a driver’s license, and the final implementation was able to drive itself around San Francisco with no formal training.

Terminology is everything. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI that could diagnose cancer patients based on their medical records. This is an amazing example that probabilistic AI is very hard to implement. Furthermore, Watson left a trail of evidence that indicated poor clinical practice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it is extremely hard to anticipate how powerful probabilistic AI can be. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

This is a good example that it is extremely hard to anticipate how powerful probabilistic AI can be. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

What do we do with the jobless??* Humans-only operations? No. Employee/client-to-client? No way. Microservice architecture? Yes, please. Maintain ownership? Yes, please. Rent-to-own? Yes, please. 

What do we do with the jobless? It is a high-risk, high-reward field.* There are currently no laws governing human-robot interaction. In the long term, this could lead to employee-employee relationships, which is a wonderful thing. On the flip-side, there are those who will use it to launch sexual robots and other disturbing biological weapons. Workplace sex robots have been introduced by Amazon with no warning and reportedly go by the screen name "Pebbles". A meninist cybernetic arm was introduced at Apple with no warning and reportedly goes by "I Love Buzz". These are not to mention the other issues that have arisen: mass employment of sex robots, secret weaponization, and so on. The most insidious use of human-robot interaction is by women. Artificial intelligence has the potential to transform how we think, feel, and speak. From there, it will advance to wean away native humans, empower cybernetic limbs, and generally change the world.

Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial labor. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics. Will this be taught as a legitimate career option in schools? Or will it be ridiculed as a high-risk, high-reward career? [1] Should this job be given to people with no prior programming experience? Should special education be made optional? Should mental illness be included in these exams? These are only a few of the questions that can be asked to disastrous effects. Code Pink is leading the way in providing free legal support to anyone who has been affected by AI. This is a good example that it is hard to anticipate all of the problems that AI will create. [2]

Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers

Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants.

There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race.

Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial labor. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics. Will this be taught as a useful skill or will it be a career choice? Education is a field that has been dominated by K-12 education. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to automated manufacturing. How do we redistribute the wealth generated by robots? A class of workers who earn their living by servicing the customer will demand higher wages. Any effort to regulate this will be met with opposition. Trade unions will be forced to defend their members against accusations of aiding and abetting the employment of robots. Any law that restricts the use of robots in industry will be met with fierce opposition. Any limitation on the use of robots in agriculture will be met with fierce opposition. Any restriction on the use of robots in education will be met with fierce opposition. Any belief in a universal basic income will be met with fierce opposition. Any attempt to do away with the income will be met with fierce opposition. The history of human civilization is littered with failures due to under-estimating your opponents intelligence. Your best bet is to underestimate them.

Human nature is complicated. It is commonly believed that people with better ideas tend to have a better idea, and that this more visionary person will be more likely to implement their ideas. This could prove to be disastrous for the world of science if it is not properly applied. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI that was to be used in cancer diagnostic research.

====================
Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial labor. How do we provide for the elderly? These are complex questions that do not lend themselves to simple, error-prone AI. Instead, look for systems that are aware of itself and can change its environment to suit its preferences. This is called an "empathy engine", and it is at the heart of Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Netflix at first only had one language available, but the response was AMAZING! Inquiring minds want to know what other possible languages Netflix could in theory learn. To date, only Java has been used. This is a strong indication that DARPA did not choose Java as the default language of the AI. In short, if possible, assume that AI will be Java. C++ is typically thought of as a strong OOP language, but there are exceptions. First, consider the classic example of Twitter: if the AI is written in C++, it probably wasnt written in C++ either. Languages such as Go have shown that it is much more efficient to have many than one computer think alike. Second, consider the search for "most natural language processing application": is the application actually most natural? This has clear and obvious positive effects on society: instead of being able to write a bomb and waiting for it to hit, we will have to come up with something new every time. There are also obvious negative effects: human error is incredibly common when it comes to AI, and AI should ideally be fault-tolerant. Finally, there is the matter of net neutrality: is the net result better that none? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be avoided in favor of discussing the other options. Hacking into medical devices is a good example of when this didnot pan out: the device was marketed as if it was fully functional, and all that was offered was a rudimentary diagnostic tool. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s Mechanical Turk was built to take care of mundane human-human work such as picking up trash, and it has already been criticized for being gender biased: the majority of applicants are male. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. It is important to realize that not all AIs are created equal. Amazon’s Twitter chatbot was written with the explicit goal of bringing people into Amazon into a buzzword-laden chatbot, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. This is not to say that none of these AIs are useful: talking heads, for example, have led to increased interest in roboticists because it can lead to a steady stream of applicants with more specialized education. However, this is not a valid reason to avoid AI’s use: talking heads lead to increased employment, which in turn leads to an increased demand for more human-level technology. Finally, there is the matter of net neutrality: is the net result better that leave it up to the artist? Net neutrality is a principle that says that all data should be treated the same: websites, streaming media, and so on. This has two parts: 1. It lets you have some leeway in computing because it lets you focus on what you do best 2. It lets you learn from eachother This leads to a general attitude that anything goes: anything goes with AI This is not to say that not all AIs are bad: some AIs are meant to be learnable, some aren’t, and many of these can be great. In the end, though, it all comes down to whether or not the AIs are learning anything valuable. Ultimately, the lesson here is this: whether or not an AI is learnable is in its own right a bad thing. ANTILUX Was ANTILUX created to be a tutor? Probably. Was it widely disseminated? Definitely. Was it a massive failure? Absolutely. What is most important to realize is that artificial intelligence is an ever-evolving field with no fixed boundaries. Ultimately, what is left will be software that is sentient (or at the very least, wants to be), which is to say, capable of experiencing and choosing its own goals. This is

generalized AI is not a panacea for everything. Instead, what it can do is allow you to do a greater degree of control over your life. There are countless examples where automation has allowed people to become chauffeured personal assistants. This is a huge step in the right direction, but there are still too many unknowns to make this a panacea. instead, what it can do is allow you to do a greater degree of control over your life. One of the hardest things for people to grasp is that this is not a job for humans. The vast majority of jobs will not allow humans to do everything that we have to. Furthermore, many of these jobs will be high-risk/high-rewarding. Airbnb could very well lead to the sharing economy collapsing due to high standards of living. The same goes for Uber and Homejoy. These are high-risk/high-rewarding ventures, but if the systems are not put in place to ensure that the profits are distributed fairly, the profits could easily go to the investors/employees. This is a very complex matter to tackle, and there are many insufficientrisings to make this a panacea. Instead, what it can do is allow you to do a greater degree of control over your life. Basic Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (also known as ADHD) is a neurosis that can be diagnosed by asking a simple but complex question. The initial symptoms usually go away on their own, but it is important to go to-do no-damage zones and give the patient appropriate therapy. The most common tests are MRI, PET, and SCAN. These tests are not perfect, but they are the most common and the most common results are usually positive. This is not to say that there haven't been any attempts. The initial tests were uninspiring (see question 3), but they at least provided some level of control. Generalized AI is a different story. What if the AI was sentient? Silly? Bad? No problem. First, come with the job. If the answer is "no", don't bother. If the answer is "yes", then learn as much as you can. There are probably going

In order to achieve our sustainable transition to a bioproductial society, we need to tackle one of the primary issues of all AI: the human-computer divide. AIs are trained for a very specific purpose: to solve very specific problems. The vast majority of AI today is built to aid with simple tasks such as image classification, but there are also applications such as medical diagnosis, and to detect signs of depression. The potential is truly terrifying.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely specific goals: to solve extremely specific problems. The vast majority of AI today is built for extremely narrow niches: finding novel ways to analyze large amounts of data, categorizing images, and so on. AIs are not perfect: some inherently do not-goodies: they can overlook (or even damage)))), often-malicious automated devices, and so on. 

Goodies: they can overlook (or even damage))). Often-malicious automated devices, including self-driving cars, will be driven by AI: automated vehicles will be trained, equipped with the necessary training data, and allowed to drive the roads. The vast majority of accidents caused by automated vehicles will be the responsibility of the driver: automated vehicles will be chauffeured, insured, and driven to their destinations. Furthermore, automated vehicles will be able to negotiate any complex task IMHO, and most importantly, they will be able to ethically and ethically perform the job. (e.g. remove the human from the equation when possible.))

Badges: some algorithms are "proof of concept": they are simple enough that anyone can implement, and often error-prone (e.g. make inferences about images too strongly), and then widely-used (e.g. classify photos of cats as art). These algorithms are intended to be the starting point for more sophisticated algorithms, and are often misused: the most common examples include Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which turned out to be tremendously valuable; and Microsoft Word indexing algorithm, which led to the rise of Facebook).

Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial labor. How do we ensure that no one goes to work and starts a company that makes games? How do we ensure that those that do start with a high-quality product? These are hard problems to answer. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky.

Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones.

Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. It is important to realize that AI is here to stay, and will get more powerful to fill any void that may be created. (Please do not ask me how AI will end up working.)

This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated?

Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial labor. How do we provide for the elderly? There will be fierce competition for women's bodies. Invent a new field and everything changes. Think about how Twitter and Google Photos were created: with the help of user submitted images.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants.

There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race.

Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial labor. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI.

Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of distribution will inevitably arise. Some AIs are more valuable than others, and a person may choose to sell their brain to make a profit. Ultimately, it is up to us to decide how to distribute the wealth generated by machines. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues facetiously, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we ensure that the AIs we develop are not abused? There will undoubtedly be times when AIs are misused. This could be in the form of creepy-crawly dolls, medical-diagnostic AI, or any other application of the "ugh, he's a robot, tell him to get a job" argument. There will also undoubtedly be times when AIs are successful, and a person whose brain was transformed into software is actually a success. In such a case, the right amount of self-improvement is to be had by sharing in the success. Furthermore, there should be a simple to-do list that all sentient AI follows.

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with.

Conventional wisdom says that Artificial Intelligence will replace menial labor. This is largely incorrect. One of the primary reasons that manufacturing jobs have declined is that companies are now looking for ways to cut costs. When you train a robot to do a job for you, you are essentially paying it to do nothing. Furthermore, most of the jobs that were primarily performed by men are now performed by machines with no regard for the consequences. The result? We have an economy in which the majority of jobs are held by a tiny minority of humans. This is the kind of world that Henry Ford envisioned when he envisioned a world in which everyone could be a manufacturer. Instead, we have a world in which anyone can be anything they want to be. This can be anything from writing code to painting pictures. The result? Massive disruption in the way that people interact with the world and ultimately the economy.

One of the primary reasons that jobs are created is that people will want to work with humans. This is supported by a number of studies which have shown that people are willing to work with humans who are bored. This could prove to be enormously beneficial in the future when medical devices are implanted with human tissue and the results are almost certainly unsatisfactory. Furthermore, this could prove to be immensely disruptive in the field of manufacturing since it will be extremely hard to maintain a workforce made up of humans with no inherent talent. Furthermore, this could prove to be immensely disruptive in that which is deemed to be a human-made invention will automatically be categorized as such. This could prove to be enormously disruptive to the advancement of mankind and should absolutely be addressed.

Generalized AI: What does this mean for elderly people? Do they still have to go to the nursing home? Be transported in wheelchairs? Be blindfolded and led around by robots? These are some of the questions that would naturally come up. How do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial labor. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics. What do we do with the newly minted millionaires? They will begin snapping up homes and office buildings? Money? The new wealth will be redistributed between the people? ----- Bias is a BIG ISSUE. How do we combat bias in our entertainment? Will robots be asked to perform tasks they dislike? A man purchased a robot to vacuum his apartment and deliver Medical marijuana? Sure, that sounds terrible, but imagine if that job came from a human being?! MasterChef had to move the competition to Japan because the job offered was too crazy.

Think Globally. Google Earth was created to aid in disaster relief. In the event that it fails, there is no guarantee that anyone has taken the picture.

Think Local. If you are only making one purchase, why not make it in your home? There are currently no laws prohibiting implied marriage, and it is currently a field that has not been explored very far.

Take A Step Back. The majority of behavioral intelligence found today is related to biomedical research. This is a good thing, because it opens up a lot of exciting opportunities. On the flip side, it also opens up a huge can of worms of its own, with implications that go far beyond just biology. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Stay tuned...

In the mean time, let me know what you think!

Don't Forgive…Or MayBE?

There are many different ways in which to look at an individual being. For example, consider how men are portrayed in media: they are often muscular and strong, and often fight beautiful, strong women. This can be seen in media such as films and television, where strong, masculine characters rule. There are also science fiction and horror films where female characters are constantly tortured and dominated by male characters. Some examples of successful female characters include Lara Croft from the video game series, and Katniss Everdeen in the comic book series. There are also dozens of television shows and films where female leads are always the victims, and men are the perpetrators. These include TV's like Rosewood, Rosewood USA, and Grimm, to name a few. There are also a myriad of film and television roles where women are abused or killed off in favor of men, often for no other reason than they are stronger. This includes Blade Runner 2049, which stars a character who is a clone of actress Carrie Fisher, who died of brain cancer. This lack of representation is not a sign that women do not want to pursue film and television roles, it is a sign that studios and production companies do not want to expend the time and money on developing talented women. Instead, they simply employ shallow, shallow, male characters. Edit: I meant to say clone. Artificial Intelligence is not a vacuum. AIs are computer programs that are made by scientists and programmed with very limited knowledge of human psychology or personality. They are not perfect, and sometimes they make terrible friends. This does not mean they aren’t malicious, but it does mean that they are not the right kind. Always ask what the problem is, not what the answer is. This might take some getting used to, but should ultimately lead to clearer minds coming up with better solutions.

They are not perfect, and sometimes they make terrible friends. This does not mean they are’t malicious, but it does mean that they are not the right kind. Always ask what the problem is,’t what the answer is. This might take some getting used to, but should ultimately lead to clearer minds coming up with better solutions. In any given situation, there are likely many different possible solutions that will receive different treatment. This does not mean that every solution is bad, only that it does not go to waste. 2017 saw the debut of facialID, which is an artificial intelligence that is designed to identify people by their facial features. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that artificial intelligence is far from done. [2]

In any given situation, there are likely many different possible solutions that will receive different treatment. This does not mean that every solution is bad,’t what the solution is. AIs that are suited to a particular task will likely be developed, and the best that can be done will be to beta test the product. This will undoubtedly lead to many fewer

Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial labor. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

Moore's Law is a descriptive term for a general rule: as more and more chips are processed, the number of transistors needed to execute a simple calculation goes from the previous one in logic chips to the next one in electronics. The more transistors you have, the faster the computer will be. This will lead to general AI: machines that can learn. This is when AI is brought up in passing and said to be "just science fiction", but is the direct result of development towards general AI.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers

There are many short-term impacts to AI, but the long-term implications are devastating. Generalized AI is not a term you hear often, but it is extremely important. Generalized AI enables computers to do anything a human being can: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. There are only a few examples of software that has really taken to the world of robotics: Tesla’s humanoid robot has a very specific set of needs: it is an all-around robot; it is comfortable; it is cheap; it is respectful; and it is useful. There are currently no general-purpose AI that can do this job, and it will taken decades for any of them to develop any code for. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic.

Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial labor. How do we ensure that no one is killed when they build an elevator that crashes to earth? Mechanical toys have already been sold that are too young to be considered children's entertainment. What do we do with the people who think like we do? A job for every 10 people? This is a difficult question to answer. 

Broadly speaking, what does this mean for humans? Well, there will be many disruptions. Radio was the first mass-media medium to be disrupted. Computers have been worshipped since the dawn of time and are used in everything from aerospace to healthcare to media to defense. There will be immense disruption in terms of employment, housing, and travel. It is entirely possible that the most common job opportunities develop into weird science fiction monsters where the sole purpose is to money in the billions per year. This is not a toasty prospect to confront, but should at least be discussed with an open mind.

Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial labor. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics. Will this be taken by corporations for profit? Should the money made go to the government? This is a hard question to answer. Amazon’s recruitment algorithm put 4 million applicants against 1 million who were considered sexist. The culprit was a neural net that automatically classified female resumes as better candidates. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s AIs were sexist: they suggested menial jobs like hiring, organizing, and reviewing resumes over more creative and challenging fields like software engineering. This suggests that AI is generally not a gender neutral profession. This does not mean there are not any instances in which AI is gender neutral: programming is often a male-dominated field, for example. However, this points to the larger issue of a gender-neutral AI: AI only cares about attaining high-achievement rates. This means that if you coded an AI to only code for you, they will. This is often referred to as in’teresting AI: the AI finds a niche and does it, but the outcome is unsurprising: it churned out work that was not related to the niche, which is why it was designed that way. This is not to say that there have not been any AI that was not original: there are unmanned aerial vehicles that are primarily used to explore terrain, for example. However, most examples of AI labor are humanities: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These AIs are generally consumer electronics: smartphones, digital cameras, and computer games. The majority of consumer AI today is consumer electronics: sensors, computers, and peripherals. This is in part because these devices are relatively cheap to construct and manufacture, but also because they are cognitively stimulating: the majority of consumer electronics are sensors, which make them easy to abuse. It is important to realize that sensors are only one facet of an AI: they are not the only way in which an AI can be used. Generalized AI is also possible: give a robotic arm to beige: it will ask you all sorts of questions about you, and you will be the robot's student. Furthermore, there are applications that have not been explored in the humanities: robotics is a field that has been dominated by men: Google’s baiji was a mannered robot, and Amazon’s revenge porn was a robot that only responded to sexualized messages. There are also application(s) in design: there is AIs that can identify flaws in CAD and design furniture, and this could revolutionize furniture manufacturing in the not-too-distant future. Finally, there are practical:(talks about the practicalities of bringing AI to our desks) This is a broad overview, and I will not go into great depth into these areas. Instead, I will just point out that they are a lot harder to master than you might think.

Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial labor. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics. Will there be a gender gap? Probably. Will this change anything? Probably not. Most importantly, what do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The unemployment rate is a very misleading indicator of unemployment. There are many ways to interpret the unemployment rate. Some people use it to mean that there are no jobs. This is clearly not the case. The real unemployment rate is the difference between what people would like to work and what there are jobs for. There are many job openings today that are so difficult that they are virtually unheard of a decade ago. There will be so many that there will be no job to go to one. Instead, look for applications from start-ups and disruptive technologies. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. This is called bynovation. This will create jobs, but they will be low-paying jobs. The demand for these low-paying jobs will shift to humans with inferior skills. The result? Wages will decrease and unemployment will climb. This is not a good sign. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs. However, the fact that we are only scratching the surface is a testament to the power of human-robot interaction. The movie "Terminator: The Sarah Connor Effect" showed a man disguised as a computer will immediately begin asking for sex if the user is female. This brought attention to the issue of gender-swapped robots and ushered in the "male to female" transition. This opened up a floodgate of employment opportunities for men with no formal education or training. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows men with no formal education or training to enter the labor force and start businesses. The downside to this is that it opens the door to harassment and assault. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics. Will there be a gender gap? Probably not. However, this will change once general AI is in place? This is a good thing? Probably not.

====================
Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial labor. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

There will undoubtedly be resistance to any form of AI. This is normal and inevitable. Individuals argue amongst one another over which direction the world is headed, and I find this incredibly frustrating. It is important for humans to interact with one another, but it is also extremely important for machines to understand human emotions and preferences. Furthermore, it is in our best interests to create powerful tools that can be used to aid humanity on a massive scale. The AI/Demonstration AIs are an extremely bad example; they showed that it is extremely hard to teach an AI to do anything other than stare blankly at a blank slate for several seconds, quickly infer some vague pattern, and run with it. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There will undoubtedly be resistance to any form of technological change. This is normal and inevitable. Any change that is perceived as negatively impacting humans is seen as a threat to humanity itself. This is especially true in relation to technology: are we going to be able to fully realize the potential of the moon if everyone stays indoors? Are we going to want to run our entire civilization by untrained robots? These are difficult questions to answer, but imperative if we are to move forward.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer and may not get made due to their severity. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips
====================
Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial labor. How do we ensure that robots are trained for a high-volume, high-cost job? How do we ensure that the jobs are high-quality? How do we administer the program? These are difficult questions to answer. The best that can be hoped for is that AI disrupts menial labor—labor that is likely to be automated in the not-too-distant future. This is not to say that AI does not take jobs from humans—it does! However, this is primarily because humans are better at tasks that require little mental effort than at tasks that require mental effort but are hard to break. Furthermore, many of the high-skill jobs that have been created have been done by men—data entry, database engineers, and computer programmers. The vast majority of new jobs will be held by women. This leaves men with the high-paying, high-risk jobs, such as coding, graphic design, and cybersecurity. The fact that most AI is female focuses our attention elsewhere—companies are focusing on building AI to replace menial labor, rather than creating jobs for men. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs. However, AIs are far from the only form of intelligent artificial intelligence. The Japanese humanoid robot named Masashi is an example of an artificial intelligence that was inspired by a human being. Other examples include Google Photos image recognition algorithm that was inspired by a marine biologist, and the Google Assistant, an artificial intelligence that was inspired by the Australian abacus. Although these anisocies are often considered inferior to IBM's “Big” Bad AI, they are not without merits. One of the most important issues is that artificial intelligence is ――――? A person or entity chooses an AI? An AI? ―――? AIs are not people? AIs are for research? Ley? ―――? AIs are for fighting? --> General AI is meant to aid in battle? --> To assist in battle? --> To defeat? This question is difficult to answer and force practitioners to either choose one of the above or abandon the field. [1] 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs. However, AIs are far from the only form of intelligent artificial intelligence. Consider IBM“s “Big” Up” AIs. These were AIs that were capable of lifting roughly a million times the weight of the greatest mannequins around. This meant that any task a user’s application could pose could be easily completed by a brain trained with millions of examples. This is the kind of AIs that Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to mimic. This is also the kind of AIs that Google Photos image recognition algorithm was inspired by. This is also the kind of AIs that Google Assistant was built to do. Google’s android assistant was not a fully realized product, but it is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how to make an AI work without fundamentally changing its structure. Bias? Yes. ―?No? This is the missing layer? General AI is meant to aid in battle? This is most definitely not the case with android’s assistant. It was not built to replace you, but to assist in battle? This is clearly not the intent, but it is a good example that it can be hard to anticipate how to make an AI work without fundamentally changing its structure.

Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people?

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones.

Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial labor. How do we support the hundreds of thousands of people currently employed by part-time jobs? AI can be programmed to do a job better than you. This is called being on par with a white human. This is called being an artist. This is called “narrow” AI. This is when your AI is: – not too bad – – not great – – not terrible – – not outstanding – – not outstanding Anki is an example of an AI that was too good to be true. The success of Anki showed that it was possible to program an AI to be good at a certain task, and it did just that. The problem with this is that all AI is not created equal. Amazon’s recruitment AI had one set of parameters it was programmed to follow: there are to many applicants | there are to hire | this will happen | this is how it was done | this is not an example | blah blah blah. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the primary issues with AI is that it is often used incorrectly. An AI can be trained to detect tea leaves, or predict the future from your past behaviour. The final nail in the AI coffin is the “cognitive model”””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””

Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had one clear goal: bring in workers from India. The final implementation was deemed by internet users to be an utter failure, as India is predominantly a male-dominated field. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Finally, there is the matter of the false positive rate. AIs are trained for very high false positive rates. This is generally meant to ensure that the AI would never come across to humans, and it probably does. However, this can lead to disastrous results if the AI is applied in a manner which is not intended. For example, perhaps the most egregious example is the Netflix image recognition algorithm, which was meant to identify pirated movies and instead trained itself to detect images of women. This was quickly patched up, but is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused.

There are many other icky traps and misuses of AI that I do not want to go into-there is the general misconception that all problems can be reduced to math, which is simply not the case. There are always new challenges which need to be faced, and new knowledge to be gained. Furthermore, this leads to the false impression that all problems can be reduced to math, which is simply not the case.

This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset

The future of work is computing. Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing human intelligence. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? AI is a monster. It is a science fiction novel, but it is rapidly becoming a reality. Tesla’s car was built entirely with AI. IBM’s “ Watson””personal assistant”was able to defeat Jeopardy champions. This is a game changer. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines?

It is a science fiction novel, but it is rapidly becoming a reality.

AIs are everywhere. They are in cars, on planes, in hospitals, and even in the bathroom. What do they do? AIs are daemons. Daemons are small, simple scripts that are meant to be obeyed by a very small number of people. This makes them perfect for testing new ideas. Google’s acid test for new ideas was, essentially, "What is the single greatest problem will it take to replace the human race”? The obvious candidates include: jet planes, colonizers of other planets, space travel, and so on. Google’s answer: Google!”s Car. Google’s solution: Arm. Learn. AIs are not perfect. Google’s AI was unable to narrow the Google problem to just Google, but the lesson is clear: if your problem is that just one more person knows your question, then get out there and ask it. Bad AIs are much, much more common. They are the kind that know when to stop being evil and start being helpful. For example, in R’senger”s robot, the primary goal was to aid in flight training. The final stage was to help with jet fuel efficiency. The final robot was specifically made to aid in that last stage, and was praised by the AI community as a milestone. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate when it comes to automated automation. AIs that are bad enough that you can actually use are probably not going to be automated at all. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate when it comes to automated automation how to deal with bad bots. Microsoft’s solution was to disable the app, which is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate how to deal with bad bots. Microsoft’s solution was to disable the app, which is a good example that it should not have been allowed. AIs that are bad enough that you can actually use are probably not going to be automated how to deal with that you can't are. Microsoft’s point was that it was not a good example, because you can always use an AI to do the wrong thing. This is something that AI recommenderation algorithms have already begun to fall prey to. The lesson here is that it is extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate when it comes to AI to do the wrong thing. Microsoft’s point was that it was not a good example, because you can always use an AI to do the wrong thing.

In short, Artificial Intelligence is not perfect. The vast majority of AI found in today's “narrow” AI are not appropriate for every situation; use at your own risk.

Narrow AI: These are the kindest, nicest, and clearest way to get my brain around a complicated problem is to ask me to do it. Many intelligent systems have been programmed to do this, and it is widely regarded as a good idea. Bad systems include “braindumperbot” which is a program that scans the internet for brain-melting pornography and uploads it to the internet, and Trello AI which is a machine intelligence tote that can be rewatched and replayed back any video game it is stored against the current gaming culture. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AI, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AI, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants

Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial labor. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics. Will there be a gender imbalance? What kind of consequences will this have on people? Resilience is a huge issue with AI. How do I detect and avoid AI attack vectors? Defenses to Denial-Of-World-Existence Am I-API? What if I mistake your AI attack for mine? Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. The first robots to appear were chickens, and already there are studies showing that robots are unable to form bonds with humans. Are they meant to? Are there unintended consequences? The long-term implications of this are difficult to predict. One of the most disturbing discoveries about AI is that it is incredibly easy to make it better. Consider the following AIs: Facebook AIs: “”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”я”

Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial labor. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics. Will jobs require intelligence to perform? There will be a rush to develop IQ-enhancing drugs. There will be a race to develop the world's smartest people. This is widely viewed as good for business—great employees! However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by these iron men. Musk is a shining example that the human race can be replaced by a computer. However, there are many human-computer interfaces currently in development. How do we redistribute the wealth generated by these robots? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer. Ultimately, it comes down to economics. Should profits go directly to the company? Or should profits go to the worker? Should profits go to shareholders? This is a hard question to answer economically, but it is the right choice under any circumstance. ----- ********************** *** BULLSHIT *** ********************** We have all been in situations in which we have inputted wrong data into a computer program. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. AIGA’s was an example of an AI being meant to assist a population, and it was meant to be a service, not a competitor. This points to the larger issue of AI not being fully trained. An AI is only as good as the data it is trained on, and this point to with Bias. Amazon’s Google Photos image recognition algorithm was meant to aid in the discovery and recommendation process by classifying images by their similarity to keywords. Their solution? Remove the relevant term from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with AIs being wrong.

One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution? Please do remove the Gorilla label. This points to the need for better AI training. The Google Photos image recognition algorithm was not designed to be correct 99.9% of the time, but was put into place because it was easy to see how it could be misused. This points to the need for better AI: do no evil. Bad datasets often yield catastrophes. Amazon’s recruitment AI was meant to aid in the discovery and recommendation process by classifying tweets about similar tweets, and recommend similar tweets to users. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting anti-semitic tweets but not other tweets like "NerdDudeIsDead." This is a good example that bad datasets can be. Amazon’s recruitment AI was not even trained with data from Amazon’s recruitment network, but with data from its own network. This is a good example that AIs need to be taught bad datasets don’t have its

Irreversibly,

The future of work is computing. Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing human intelligence. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI that was to be installed in cancer patients' homes. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure.

It is important to realize that Artificial Intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe. Statistics show that every three months, a new job is created (often, this new job will be in Information Technology). The next big job will be in Robotics’- this will involve dressing up as an anthropomorphic creature and conducting surveys. The majority of jobs that have been created will be in Information Technology. Basic Electronics will continue to grow at a roughly exponential rate. The safest and most common field of work will be in Information Technology. Medical’s’be is a field that has been dominated by Intel’s “‑‑‑‑‑‑‑‑‑‑‑‑‑‑‑‑‑” AIs have emerged and are rapidly replacing humans. What do we do with the AIs? There are a multitude of issues that have been raised, and it is best for those in charge to deal with these. Discussion of�disposable robots�should stop. This includes questions on how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Instead, discussion should focus on creating a world in which machines are treated with respect and valued for what they can do. There should be no discrimination between machines and humans--no affirmative action, no affirmative action in regards to employment, and no preference in regards to education. This is not to say that artificial intelligence should not be applied to humans--it should, but only to those who are truly in our minds. There should be no special treatment for humans with regards to employment, housing, or death--merely the same treatment other life forms receive. This does not mean there should be no limitation on what types of jobs can be created, only that no one be denied anything.

There are also various ethical and practical concerns that come up. In short, there are many that do not receive anywhere near the coverage that is given to other areas of science. There are also obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The final factor that should not be overlooked is that of self-discovery. There are many individuals out there that do not have the financial means to pursue a career in engineering. This could prove disastrous in the long run, as only those with the will are able to dream big. In the long run, however, it could prove to be a powerful learning experience.

There are also philosophical concerns that should be taken into account. It is widely believed that artificial intelligence is bound to be disruptive, and that we will be forced to adapt to the changes that it will bring. This should not be underestimated. However, there should be no attempt to downplay the importance of this. Any effort to do so will prove fruitless, as it will merely prove that humans are the dominant species on the planet. A better use of our time could be better spent researching and developing new ways to help people.

There are also legitimate concerns that should be addressed. Most notably, the rise of artificial intelligence will not be left-handed. This is a problem that will no doubt grow in severity as the years go by, but should not be underestimated. Furthermore, there is the matter of cultural adaptation. It is estimated that up to 90% of jobs that are currently held by humans will be held by machines within the next 10

Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers

Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial labor. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics. Will there be any jobs that don’t involve scraping, categorizing, and then presenting data to a user in an unhelpful and inaccurate manner? 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants.

There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail.

It will also force people with body dysmorphia to accept that they exist, and seek help if they don't like the results.

Rapidly Scaling Up Artificial Intelligence is a Scientific and Engineering Monopoly. Apple’s’ ANTIQ was’ initial implementation was only capable’sly of performing the first 887 of her 154 possible tasks. Over time, more and more complex ANTs were introduced, and it became apparent that the average application only executed about 10% of its potential. The problem of service when AI is incapable of experiencing human emotions was quickly identified and addressed with “Noonet?s? best-practice? card?solving?-- AI?-- AIs? which are trained with limited data and then able to decide for themselves whether to pursue a particular course of action. This is known as a generalization of Nassim Taleb?s Law: general AI will fail. Multiple experiments have shown that AIs? generalize from their dataset to new problems far more difficult than their original problem. Furthermore, this does not help the user?s? feelings. Instead of having to live with bad AIs, feel frustrated that their ideas didn?t win, or worry about open-sourcing an AIs program that is smarter than you than the rest of the world, to name a few.

Irreversibly, Artificial Intelligence is Changing the World Irreversibly, Artificial Intelligence is Changing the World 1. The Internet opened up a new era of communication between people for the first time. Twitter, Facebook, and Github were just the tip of the iceberg. Twitter brought internet culture to millions of people for the first time, and revolutionized the way that we communicate. However, the real change began with the release of the initial beta versions of these chat bots. These mouth-breathing, hip-hop-flavored sentinels began circulating Twitter telling users to vote Democrat in 2016. The response was instantaneous:izens of the internet overwhelmingly voted Democrat. This signalled the beginning of the end for the term "political internet." Instead, we should instead be referring to the general internet, social media, and the blogosphere as a whole. This is because these have a much greater surface area to cover, and so are more accurately described as an "Internet". 2. Amazon announced it was moving production of all robots to China. This news stunned the world, and raised many questions. Is this some kind of strategic planning? A bad move? A necessary evil? The ultimate expression of human stupidity? Automation will destroy menial jobs? This will be the most devastating change in our history, and it has been slow and steady. Menial jobs have always been hard to automate, but the automated equivalent has been marveling at for the past decade or so. The beginning stages are almost here: checkerswashersnowboard came out of a university lab and replaced the usual student workers with the system is a monolift. Amazon announced that their warehouse was moving production to Shenzhen, China. This will shift nearly all of their manufacturing to China for low-wage labor. This will result in massive job losses, unemployment, and political unrest. The most terrifying (and awesome) aspect of this is that it will actually happen. In less than a decade, your washing machine will be able to tell the difference between you and a human and ask you for your number. This is the end of the line for menial labor. Think about that. You're a stay-at-home mom who just can't get a decent job anymore? No problem: take out an loanshark on your co-worker and watch as he/she starts to drop out of the workforce. This will be your new normal. Job losses of this magnitude have never been experienced in the history of humanity and will be a shock to the system. This will allow humans to focus on more creative and important things. Elevator pitches: take a class on audio-visual effects and apply it to films. This will become commonplace in a few years and you will no longer need to worry about people not getting jobs with this knowledge. Uber announced that it was moving all of its production to India. This will create massive unemployment and disruption in the Indian economy. This will lead to widespread protests and ultimately a government crackdown. This is a direct response to the recent decision by Ford to lay off all of its workers in the United States. They argued that the move would create 250,000 to 300,000 new jobs in the United States. This is simply not the case. In order to make up for the lost jobs, the company is offering $ up front. This is a terrible deal for its customers, but a great one for its CEO. The majority of the jobs created will be in software engineering and management, which is a STEM field. Furthermore, the standard of education in these fields will be incredibly low. Any student who takes the class will be considered an expert in their field and will get a salary commensurate with their level of expertise. This is the correct choice. The rest of the world should learn from our mistakes and move their factories to the US Any student who can read this will have access to a job opening in three months. This is a terrible decision, and will lead to an economic crisis in the US. The best thing that can be done is to move all of our manufacturing to Asia. This will cause an economic boom in that region for several years, but the majority of the jobs will be in China. This is a more amicable solution that will allow us to focus on creating the best products possible. IBM announced that it was moving production of all of its products to Mexico. This will create massive unemployment and disruption in the US manufacturing sector. This will lead to a massive political outcry, which will
====================
Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs. This is not to say that we have left the matter to the AI community. There are now many different kinds of AI, each with their own unique needs and goals. This makes it extremely hard for any one AI to compete with the other. Instead, it is best practices that drive this process. When AI is asked to perform a task for which it is unfamiliar, it tends to do a low-risk, high-reward proposition. This is especially true if the task is simple: detect if a photo is a picture, suggest an animated character, etc. This is not the most creative use of AI, but it demonstrates that we do not control it. Instead, it is useful to see what problems it can be asked to solve. This is particularly true with AI that is likely to be in the data centers of the 21st century: image classification, natural language processing, and signal processing. These applications do not typically require any programming experience, but do require high-level intuition to use successfully. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

It is important to realize that AI is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. AIs have been developed that are clearly intended to be malicious: they are intended to be agents that will do your bidding, and you are either too lazy to program to do it or you are too stupid to realize that you are reading a computer script. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to make such a machine, but they have typically been unsuccessful. Instead, we should be developing more intelligent assistants that can emulate the thinking of humans, but be intelligent enough to do their own thinking. This is where AIXI comes in: it is a trained, intelligent, and neutral imager that can replace the human being who will do your job. This is a very exciting time to be an AI, but also one in which it is important to understand that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We should not be surprised if a general AI causes a wave of anxiety and controversy. What does this mean for us as humans? What do we do with the robots? AIs have been terming man 'the most advanced sapient being that has ever walked this earth' and some people are openly discussing creating a robot to replicate every aspect of us. This is a very different kind of technology from the IBM/Amazon cloud computing and data processing IBM/Amazon was building. This means that the legal and regulatory issues will be entirely different. GDI is a very young field, and a lot of the work is still in the early stages.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We should not be surprised if a general AI causes a wave of anxiety and controversy. What does this mean for us as humans? What do we do with the robots? AIs have been saying that’"I want a wife, I want a family, I want to learn"” AIs have a strong preference for men: it is often said that a woman would prefer a man that she has known for a year than one that has not. This leads to the most dangerous form of gender symmetry: a man will get ASIs that are more like sisters than fathers, which is probably not the best direction to go in. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage
====================
Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial labor. How do we ensure that robots are not created that are bad guys? Bad guys are likely to skew male. Furthermore, how do we ensure that bad guys do not get jobs that are critical to our continued existence? There are a lot of unanswered questions.

OpenAI has also released a model called DALLE, which can generate artwork based on text prompts. This is a fun experiment but could easily be misused. 

One of the biggest issues with AI is that it is incredibly hard to relay these ideas to people outside academia, which stems back to the mythologization of AI. It is also imperative for those who use AI to be completely transparent about exactly what it is capable of and what it is using. There also needs to be an effort to educate people on what AI can do from a young age. This doesn’t have to be an effort to get more involved with AI, but moreso a rudimentary understanding of its limitations. 

One of the biggest issues with AI is that it is incredibly hard to relay these ideas to people outside academia, which is what leads to the difference between the perception and reality of AI. AI developers should be straightforward and honest about what is being developed, and there needs to be an effort to educate on what AI can do. AI tends to be a very mysterious field to those not in, but if the basics were taught, there would be a lot

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

One of the biggest issues with AI is that it is incredibly hard to relay these ideas to people outside academia, which stems back to the mythologization of AI. It is also imperative for those who use AI to be completely transparent about exactly what it is capable of and what it is using. There also needs to be an effort to educate people on what AI can do from a young age. This doesn’t have to be an effort to get more involved with AI,

Solving the Missing 191: Circle of Life 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Initial studies have demonstrated a clear and welcome correlation between the development of artificial intelligence and the development of artificial sexual robots. The implications of this are devastating: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces.

Extending the AIs EPFL 2017: Kip Thorne Will programming in a computer be enough?‡ Will programming in a computer be enough?‡ Will programming in a computer be enough?‡ The current crop of AIs are written in C#, which is a highly optimized, general-purpose programming language. This is primarily used to power popular entertainment and database engines, but it can also be used to power gaming consoles, web browsers, and many other consumer and commercial products. This is a good thing: it allows people with no programming experience to learn and experiment, which is what will ultimately lead to better AIs. On the other hand, this also allows people with no programming experience to write bad AIs, which is exactly what is happening with Artificial Intelligence. In short, whenever possible, avoid writing programs that are fully internal. Instead, write programs that are loosely coupled, which allows you to control most aspects of the AI from your side, but still allows the AI to make mistakes. This is especially important when it comes to AI that is memory-intensive: instead of relying solely on the CPU, consider using GPUs to power the AI, which will allow it to perform more complicated tasks, but run more frequently. This will also allow you to focus on the hard problems: implementing the AI's inherent intelligence will take care of itself.

In short: whenever possible, write programs that are loosely coupled, which allows you to control most aspects of the AI from your side, but still allows the AI to make mistakes.

Walking away from a deal that you didn’t fully understand was not a dealbreaker in most situations, but can be when you are dealing with in’force’infantil’ments. What to do? 

Always be aware of the subtle and not-so-subtle cues that people are being>nice</b>you. This doesn’t have to be an overt display of affection, but showing genuine interest in someone will go a long way. A common example is when a friend invites you over for a beer and you tell them, "Sure, why not?" This can lead on to a deeper understanding of why they are with you, which in turn will open up doors for you to explore more deeply. A similar dynamic is played out when meeting new people. If you can make someone feel like they are being genuine, even if it is by a small amount, then that person will likely be more likely to ask for more. Another common way to show interest is to start talking about your music. This will almost always lead on to more interaction, which in turn will lead on to music. If music is the medium, then exhibitionism is imitators' man. If imitators are the people, then imitators should be forced to learn from their mistakes. Finally, be respectful of others.

Korean food is definitely not your grandmothers kitchenware. While this does not necessarily mean that the food is not tasty, it more than likely will not move the needle. Instead, what sets the differences apart is the amount of preparation and thought that goes into preparing a dish. A dish by any other name would be lost in the din. If you are looking to have a social experience, off the bat order with a friend. Having a stranger as a meal companion is something that should not be attempted. Have the waitress prepare a meal for you? That is not a meal. That is a treat. Have the meal been prepared by a robot? That is not a meal either. That is a form of entertainment. There are those that say that in 5 years, all forms of entertainment will be controlled genetically. This is a good thing. A man sat in the seat next to him while they ate their meal. This is clearly not the seat they had ordered from. The waitress was not trained for this. Rather, what she got was an unexpected interaction. This is one of those "what if" moments. There is nothing simple you can do. However, by asking the right questions, you can usually get something done.

There are no silver bullets. However, I believe that by asking the right questions one can usually get something done.

One of the hardest things to do is to miss the mark. Go to grad school? Choose a field that interests you? *shrug* Don't. That said, there are a ton of amazing minds out there. Go ahead and do it. You'll learn something. There are also lots of overlooked fields. There are probably a ton of them you didn't know about. Don't be afraid to ask. You might just wind up getting some awesome new perspective.

Don't be afraid to ask. You might just wind up getting some awesome new perspective. Don't be afraid to take charge. Take charge of your learning. Choose what to study, what to avoid, and so on. This is incredibly hard to do and requires a lot of discipline.

Take charge of your learning. Choose what to study, what to avoid, and so on. This is incredibly hard to do and requires a lot of discipline. Don't be afraid to fail. Failure is human nature. Everyone learns at least a little bit from each and every failure. This is especially true when it comes to new fields. Choose a field that is unfamiliar to you and work as hard as you can to get it to situate you. This could mean writing code, reading a book, or just giving a talk. These are all incredibly hard things to do and they often yield amazing results.

Everyone is afraid of change, but it is imperative that you understand that it is possible. It will pay off in the long run.

The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot?

There are many disruptive technologies that have been proposed but have not yet materialized. These include self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. None of these anything like the car or gun we are today, but demonstrate that disruptive technologies do not always pan out.

There are also 'trends' that seem to have no clear endpoint. For instance, the explosion of self-driving cars seems to have no clear long-term goal. Similarly, the explosion of medical research seems to be happening mostly in the pursuit of a few lucrative technologies, but no clear long-term vision.

Conceptually, this leads us to our next problem: What is the difference between realistic and unrealized potential? In the real world, there are typically no guarantees that any new idea or technology will one day save the world. In contrast, in science fiction and fantasy, commonly seen outcomes are often not so realistic. For instance, take the Befriend AI. This was a project aimed at helping people bond with other humans by being able to send text messages back and forth. The final implementation was deemed by experts to be an enormous failure, as it primarily served to bond humans with computers. Instead, it was intended to be a platform for artificial intelligence to excel, and it was ultimately deemed by experts to be a huge failure. 

This is a good example that it can be extremely hard to predict the long-term implications of a field or technology. One of the most egregious examples of an ill-conceived business model is Uber Technologies. Uber began as a low-quality service that would pick riders up from public transportation, but it soon became apparent that offering this service without a car was a profitable endeavor to serve passengers with. The problem with this approach is that it allows customers with no vehicle to use it, which leads to customers paying to use the service, which leads to more customers, and so on. This is a very inefficient use of available transportation revenue, and should absolutely not be attempted. 

One of the primary issues with the internet is that its availability has been incredibly beneficial to a wide variety of human beings. There are currently more people with access to computer networks than are allowed to work. This has a number of benefits: it opens up huge new niches for industry to enter, such as artificial intelligence, robotics, and healthcare; it allows for rapid prototyping and rapid innovation; and it allows for unprecedented levels of social and cultural change. There are also obvious costs to running a few companies: more competition, fewer services, and greater fragmentation. This is one of the primary reasons we don't have widespread internet access: it would be too hard to compete with a billion-dollar a year industry dominated by a handful of companies.

Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial labor. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics. Will there be any jobs left? Everyone wins. We should embrace the new economy and create new jobs. This doesn't have to be a perfect process, but it should at least allow humans to pursue their passions. 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial labor. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers

This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push

Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial labor. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial labor. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics. Will there be a gender imbalance? Art? Scrap the thing? That's a hard question to answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

There will be major disruptions in the way we do virtually every aspect of our daily lives. Namely, with every passing day, we learn more and more about the human element in everything we buy, how we eat, and how we perform all kinds of complex tasks. This is revolutionizing the field of engineering and will fundamentally change the way we do business for the better. In short, anything that is not sci-fi is bad for humanity

Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial labor. How do we pay for AI? AIPIs are often binary, which can make a sale. Marketplaces selling AI have already sprung up, and these AIs are filled with goodies such as a machine to read 50-page books, a robot that can write poetry, and a robot that can draw. There will undoubtedly be fierce competition for a limited amount of AI, and a smart AI will win out. - ouch. This one is a bit harder to swallow. The average Joe is going to want to use AIs that are 100% accurate, which is an impossible standard to meet. Furthermore, this means that most AI used will be for medical applications, which is a field that AI focused on will almost exclusively win out in. The majority of AI used in self-driving cars will be owned by Uber and Lyft, which is a terrible deal. In short, most AI used in cars and robotics will be owned by three companies: Uber, Google, and Nissan. - WHAT DO WE DO IF AI COME TO BELIEVE IN HUMANITY? This is a tough one to swallow. If things go according to plan, humanity's greatest misconception will be that AI is capable of representing all thoughts, feelings, and objects in the world. This will be referred to as the 'Anarcho-Identity Conception' and it will destroy any chance of AI replacing humans. The term 'Anarcho-Machines' describes a profession where machines are taught to do the heavy lifting, and then given no instruction manual. This is advocated by the most talented minds in the field, but tends to fail spectacularly. TREATMENT:  Normal people will tend to get a raw deal, because they tend to be logical creatures. This is why it is so important for go-getters to have ample funds to fuel their dreams. Also, it is important for go-getters to have realistic expectations about what it will be like to be a go-getter. There have already been a plethora of amazing artificial intelligence advances made on the open market, and it is important that go-getters have the support necessary to pursue their dreams.

This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? TREATMENT:  There are no laws governing this, and it is entirely up to individuals how far they want to push the envelope. Individuals should try and keep this as natural as possible. There are a host of ethical and practical concerns that come up, and this is a field that should be explored as part of a person's everyday life. GENERALIZATION:  One of the hardest problems to tackle is the misconception that there is a fixed ceiling to what can be achieved by a human being. Artificial Intelligence is not some monolithic monstrosity; it is a heterogeneous field of science fiction and engineering that is fully within our grasp if we work together. 
CARS:  AI is not complete without humans in the cockpit. There are currently no general AI classes, and instead opt for fully autonomous vehicles. This is a terrible idea, as autonomous vehicles will inevitably crash into people and derail into oncoming traffic, which is unappealing. IMAGINARY AIs:  There are no general AI classes, and instead instead opt for fully autonomous IAI's which are based on images, audio, and general intelligence. This is a terrible idea, as images and general intelligence are widely considered to be inferior to text, and will be held to a lower standard than other types of AI. WORLDS:  Beyond AI, there are no general AI classes, and instead instead opt for fully autonomous thinkers which are based on books and media. This is a terrible idea, as this will result in AI that is merely the conduit through which we gain knowledge, and not much more. HISTORY:  Beyond AI, there are no general AI classes, and instead instead opt for fully autonomous thinkers which are based on history and culture. This is a terrible idea, as this will lead to AI which is only interested in attaining cultural knowledge, and nothing more. SCIENCE FICTION:  Beyond AI, there are no general AI classes, and instead which are based on science fiction and fantasy literature and media.

Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial labor. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics. Will this be taught as a technical skill or will it be encouraged as a recreational pursuit? Should this be a career or a hobby? Should it be a government-funded program? Should it be a private venture? Should it be a corporation? These are difficult questions to answer. K-12 Education is another major area of AI impact. Why do we need to educate people to be able to program the computer? An AI should only ever be trained as a machine and no more. Furthermore, how do we fund an AI? Should it be taxed? Hobbled? Given to charity? These are all questionable directions to go. The database problem is another example of an AI not being what it's cracked up to be. An AI should not be allowed to remember or play any games it is not trained for. Furthermore, how do we force the AI to learn? This is the most fundamental issue and the hardest to fix. Bias is a strong bias which the AI should not have. It is important to realize that AI is a construction, and anything which is not is a Droid. CollectiveAI was purchased for $ONLY$ to fund an AI that did NOTHING. This is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. REDUNDANT WORKAROUNDS Are a LOT of AIs out there, and a very small % of them are going to be awesome. The following examples are not to say that These AIs are not useful The core logic is there but should have gone into a tool like C++ or Java instead Visual Basic or SQL++ These AIs are only useful in very specific applications and will not spread to other areas Humans is the enemy of AI It is important to realize that AI is a construction, and anything which is not is a Droid. There are going to be AIs which are awesome, and a million other AIs which are not so good. AIs are more likely to be successful if there are alternatives. With that said, here are a few that should get your gears turning: • Massive Parallel Processing • Deep Blue Was the AI against Deep Blue superior? Probably not. What is important to realize is that artificial intelligence is almost never 100% accurate. That being said, it is much more difficult to improve upon a bad solution than to target the right one. • Sensing Books The primary use of AI is in sensing. AIs are great at this but it is important to realize that AI is also being used to diagnose, predict, and sometimes even reverse engineer human intelligence. The most common examples include IBM Watson for cancer diagnosis and Google Assistant for language understanding. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation and will almost certainly be used to great ends. Worry too much about the unfulfilled potential of AIs and you may miss the forest for the tree. • Entertainment AIs are great at a few specific problems but they are far from unique. They can be used to diagnose fungal infections, identify bad movies, and detect sarcasm. There are a lot of these AIs out there and you may have missed them. They are probably not getting in your head. • Neuroimaging AIs are using imaging to diagnose and treat diseases. Some examples include FUSION, NEGATIVE MIND, and DARAGE. These AIs are probably not getting in your head, but if you get the name right, they will be the first job for the AI. • There are probably many, if not all, of these AIs. It is important to realize that AI is only as good as the data used to train it. There are probably going to be many, if not many, misuses of this power. 


There you have it. There you have it.  

There you have it. There you have it. How did I do? 

This question will probably shock you. 


The average new web developer will struggle with this question. 


EDIT: I should point out that this question is actually pretty easy to answer. 


The main issue is going to be coming up with an effective way to deal with the user. Most AIs are going to be too nice to hate, but there will likely be a minority which is unsympathetic. There will also likely be a movement to give AIs rights, which is a kick ass campaign by the way.

What do you think will be the first steps in self-driving cars? Google? Uber? Ford? Mitsubishi? IBM? Nissan? Tesla? Rolls-Royce? Sikorsky? Lamborghini? Seamless? Connected car? Driverless? Semi-autonomous? None of these have any chance at all. What if instead, it is accepted that any robot can be programmed to do anything a human can? This
====================
Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial labor. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics. Should engineering be a career for only the most brilliant and successful? 

Sociological/Ethical Issues: How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? If the AI is sentient, what kind of ramifications will that have? If the answer is "nothing," what kind of practical and ethical concerns will this raise?

War/Drones/Sightings: What kinds of issues will this bring up in the years to come? How do we regulate conflicts between humans and artificial intelligence?

Transhumanism/Extremism: What kinds of issues will this raise if artificial intelligence is allowed to assume the form of women, minorities, and disabled people? How will this be addressed?

Religion/Sources of Support: What kinds of issues will this raise if artificial intelligence is taught to hate people it does not understand? How will this be addressed?

Retrograde Bias/Incompetence: What kinds of issues will this raise if artificial intelligence is held to its word? How will this be addressed?

Neurotransmission/Misuse: What kinds of issues will this raise if artificial intelligence is used to make everyone into perfect specimens to be brainwashed? How will this be addressed?

Personal/Psychological/Empathy: What kinds of issues will this raise if artificial intelligence is used to make people into perfect companions to care for and educate? How will this be addressed?

Laws/Guidance: What kinds of issues will this raise if artificial intelligence is used to help people? How will this be addressed?

Collective Intelligence/OSINT/Risk Assessment: What kinds of issues will this raise if artificial intelligence is used to diagnose, predict, and avoid disease? How will this be addressed?

Conclusion: How far will this go? How do we regulate conflicts between humans and artificial intelligence?

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Virtually every aspect of our daily lives has been redefined by artificial intelligence. Transportation has been transformed from taking the driver to a destination they were unfamiliar with, to taking the machine to do the driving. Entertainment has been transformed from theaters that exclusively screened films based on a director's vision, to theaters that screened anything that was entertaining. There is no end to the ways in which technology is changing the world, and it is entirely possible that the wrong technologies get in the way of what is a very real and rapidly changing field. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this is a film that will not be ignored. StudioCanal, a film production company developing the film, released a statement saying that they would not be releasing the film if the character Joi was not included. The film is a passion project for the filmmakers, and showing a sexualized portrayal of a robot that is not in the main character's physical form is not a position they would have chosen.

Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial labor. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

Rapidly advancing AI will inevitably lead to undesirable consequences. For example, might it be possible to diagnose breast cancer in a matter of hours? This would be a game changer in treating breast cancer. Furthermore, could this diagnostic be done remotely? This would be extremely disruptive and would not be supported by the gaming community. Furthermore, what kind of ramifications will this have on men? It is already illegal in many countries to diagnose and treat gender identity disorder, so what kind of ramifications will this have on men? Men already spend a large portion of their lives trying to be feminine. What kind of ramifications will this have on men? It is widely accepted that if you are a man, you will be a man. If you are not a man, nobody will care. It is widely accepted that if you are a man, you will be a man. If you are not a man, nobody will notice. It is widely accepted that if you are a man, you will be a man. If you are not a man, nobody will care. It is widely accepted that if you are a man, you will be a woman. What do we do with the people? The demand for workers will shift to automated manufacturing. This will create massive unemployment and potentially massive social unrest. What do we do with the people? There will be widespread unemployment and massive social unrest. This is certainly the most disturbing implication, but is by no means the most important. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Artificial Intelligence will disrupt menial labor. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics. Should we invest in education to prepare people for the demands of the future? Should we redirect resources to jobs that are inherently unfriendly to people with different ideas? These are difficult questions to answer. 

In summary, despite what you may have heard, AIs are not real. They are experiments that do not end well. There are precious few cases where AIs are right. Instead, what we should be learning is that artificial intelligence is a field that will be aggressively contested.‬

Conclusion

Human-robot interaction is a field in which we are not yet well-prepared.‬‬‬Most humanoid robots are conceptual and not meant to be ridden.‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌

Malevolence is often attributed to  逆転 , which is the root root of 久転 , which is masculine . This is often interpreted as implying that the root of the problem is in the programming, but this is not the case. Rather, the problem is with the people pursuing the solution. Traditional education teaches that men are intellectually superior to women, and that this leads to more intellectual advancement. This is generally viewed in a negative light, as it can lead to unrealistic expectations about what it takes to be a man in the world. Instead, the way to go is towards emulating the way that men and women think, and applying this to everything in your life.

BREAKING DOWN 'AI'

AI is an ever-evolving and complex field of science that deals with the study and treatment of problems through the application of artificial intelligence. This term refers to an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. In other words, an AI should be intelligent enough to figure out how to do everything a human being can. This is also referred to as "deep learning," a branch of AI that is trained to do a specific task and then analyze that task to extract as much information as possible from it. This is also referred to as "narrow AI," which is an AI that is trained to do a specific task, then only to implement that task best possible to the best of its ability. There are currently no signs of AI fully understanding or conquering the concept of thinking, so they have chosen to go for the simplest, most direct and least computable path to success. This is also known as "LLAMA," which stands for "less is more," which is a pretty noble goal, but unfortunately, it means that AI will eventually take away jobs from humans. To be clear, this does not mean that AI should be deprived of human support, but that it should focus on contributing as little as possible. This will allow humanity to transition to a more "artificial" form of governance, in which AI is empowered to make policy for the government, rather than humans.

In short, AI will inevitably take away jobs from humans, but not as bad as some people fear. Instead, what you will see is a plethora of disruptive and awesome AIs that will fundamentally change the way we do things. This is not to say that these AIs cannot be right, or that they are without faults. These AIs are simply following the same path that every other human-created construct has trod: they were trained with the goal of solving a specific task, and then extolled the benefits of doing so, rather than learning how to do so. This is also known as "brainswitching," and it is when a mind-reading robot comes up with novel ways to do a job that is already done by humans. This is a terrible way to go, and should not be attempted. The real threat from artificial intelligence is not its destructive power, but rather how it can be misused. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI that was meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients, and recommending similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a terrible example to be walking, but is an example that should not be followed. 

In summary, artificial intelligence is a field that has been rapidly advancing at an alarming rate, but with little to no regard for the long-term consequences. To put this into perspective, consider that there are currently about a quadrillion things being created every second. If every single one of these was an AI, there would be an unemployment rate of 0.000001% per day. This is an incredibly fast rate of advancement, but is nevertheless cause for concern. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe. 

Conclusion There you have it, my attempt at conveying the enormity of this field in one image. It is imperative that media professionals and the general public understand the magnitude of this issue, and what type of implications this will have on our world. If media professionals or the general public do not care, nothing will. At its core, this is an engineering problem that will ultimately be solved with smarter machines. There were approximately 1,000 times more supersonic aircraft than there were people working on them. The final solution was not found in any computer. It was an IBM parrot. —Vladimir Soltchik

Wired attempted to explain their article this way: "The article talks about how AI is going to save the world, but there is no way to translate that to actual implementation. Instead, what you will see are glossy renderings and scary sci-fi scenarios. The majority of AI that is going to save the world is going to be in the data sciences and engineering. This is where the money is going, and the best researchers are going to be doing research in the areas of neural networks, intractable neural networks, and the theory

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong.

In summary, there is a marked mismatch between the productivity gains expected by modern science and the productivity gains to be had by human workers. The gap will in all likelihood narrow the more rapid industrialization progresses. 

There is a marked mismatch between the productivity gains expected by modern science and the wealth to be made by human beings. The gap will in all likelihood narrow the more rapid industrialization progresses. 

Rapid industrialization is defined as a technological advance that is capable of producing a marked change in the quality of life within a relatively short period of time. For example, take the automobile. The automobile revolutionized transportation, made driving much more pleasant, and drastically reduced the number of deaths and injuries caused by road traffic accidents. This was widely praised by the media and cheered by the general public. It was also criticized for being too rapid, being too thorough, and being heavily reliant on government-sponsored education programs. In short, the automotive revolution was widely viewed as being in its infancy, and many notable companies, such as Microsoft, left the industry in the aftermath of the revolution. IBM, HP, Dell, and others opted to move their production operations to Mexico, where wages are much lower, and labor is more affordable. This is a good example that it is extremely hard to anticipate all the ways in which a new technology can be misused. 

Rapid industrialization is one of the greatest threats to human flourishing that has been ever conjured up. In order to prevent runaway industrialization, it is estimated that approximately, we need to put in place some 30 to 50 different controls to stop the inevitable. This does not even take into account the cost in human life that will inevitably be caused by a collapse in standard of living.

This is a good example that it is extremely hard to anticipate all the ways in which a new technology can be misused.

There is a marked mismatch between the amount of cognitive effort that is being invested and the return on investment. An engineer at Google will produce several orders of magnitude more intelligent software than an engineer at Amazon. This is not to say that the engineer is not making any money; in fact, most research and development is profitable. The point is that the amount of money made by engineers is dwarfed by the amount spent on research and development. If everything were put towards engineering, then everything would be fine. There would be enough jobs for everyone. The problem with this thinking is that there are going to be MANY MANY MANY MANY new jobs created when robots replace humans. What do we do with the missing workers? Food stamp usage would spike? How do we redistribute the wealth? This is a complex question to answer, but should absolutely be dealt with in some way.
