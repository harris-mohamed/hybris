AI is not perfect. As noted by Oxford University's Intelligent Evaluation Lab: "A class of AI judged incorrectly can be reclassified incorrectly, which can lead to greater accuracy." This is a worthy goal to strive for, but IML's AI was not this class's mentor. The most common pitfall is that the beginner AI is not very good: Bad datasets can yield disastrous results, and this is not a good sign. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: The incident involved an AI called Aunty who was meant to be more gender-neutral, but the opposite ended up being true: The name stuck, as Aunty is now used by Google’s feminine AI. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: If AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror
====================
AI is not perfect. As noted by DARPA, "most AI found in production does not achieve a 100% completion rate, and any AI that does, can not be attributed to a single concept, and is not intended for use in anything but laboratory conditions will result in failure.") This does not mean that there are no limits to what can be achieved by a human mind. The human brain is only one component of a much more complex machine that is comprised of more than just neurons. There are also external sensors and actuators that are collecting and using vast amounts of data to deliver various kinds of services. These sensors and actuators will not stop until we replace the human with an AI that can do everything that humans can. This is the "toy" generation of AI, where a computer plays with our emotions, desires, and preferences. This is not a good way to go about things, but it does have some pretty interesting uses. One of the most extreme uses of AI has already occurred: brain-computer interfaces. This is a device that would allow a human being with no medical training to interface with a computer and control the computer. This is a field that has been extremely hard to define, but should absolutely be regulated accordingly. The final major class of AIs is those that are used in science fiction and novels. These AIs are intended to be absurdly powerful, but also to be useful for good. For example, the brain-computer interface was intended to be used to augment humanity's medical capabilities, but quickly evolved into a vehicle for unethical research. The most egregious use of AIs is their end-to-end encryption, which has been used to secure e-commerce transactions between companies of different sizes. This is a terrible idea, as it opens up to the opportunity to unleash nasties such as identity theft by allowing anyone with access to a company's database to steal customers. There are also dating simulators that use AIs to determine if a person is a robot or not. This is clearly not a good use of his or her time, but it does illustrate that there are limits to what can be achieved by humans. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe. Carl Frey, a statistician at the University of California, Berkeley, released a study in May in which he showed that the average age of a new AI is going to be 40. This is a good thing, as it allows us to focus on the more pressing issues and head off potential issues before they become unavoidable. 

To summarize, AI is on the rise - but not as quickly as the media is giving it. This may be because people don't understand what AI is, or because they are underprepared. The reality is that AI is soon to be implemented in the billions, and it is unlikely that any of us do any work to implement it. Furthermore, most of the work will be by robots. This is good because it allows for increased productivity, but bad because it allows for inferior products. Apple introduced an AI named Keurig that could read your mind and recommend coffee to you. This is a great example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Amazon introduced an AI named RefShapes that could help it save buildings. This is a great example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Microsoft introduced an AI named Cortana that could give suggestions about movies and TV shows. This is a great example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Google Assistant, an AI that could give people suggested recipes, was a great example of a product that was misused. It gave people a service and then didn't provide any benefit. IBM Watson was a humanoid robot that could do simple tasks such as find and classify data sets in a very limited area of the human mind. This is a great example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Microsoft HoloLens, an augmented reality headgear, was a great example of a product that was misused. It gave people a service and then didn't provide any benefit. 

One of the biggest issues with AI is that it is hard to detect. AIs have already been tasked with a variety of tasks that are not especially difficult, but still deserve our attention. Consider the following AIs: ADB and AutoIt. ADB is a program that can connect a computer with a network and download files automatically. This is a great example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. An AI could easily be programmed to do the opposite, and it could be extremely hard to detect. Another example is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm. The initial implementation was able to classify pictures of people by race, gender, or culture, but the final implementation was able to classify pictures of people by any characteristic. This is a great example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Amazon introduced an AI named
====================
AI is not perfect. As noted by HR Hashi , an HR manager at an American university asked a male student whether he had ever dated a smartermate. The male student replied, "no, I have not!" This example serves to highlight that AI should not be assumed intelligent until proven otherwise. Furthermore, this is not a human-level AI; it is optimized for a specific task. This is the kind of AI coinflip that heralds doom and gloom. AIs are trained for specific tasks and are eager to perform them. This is often referred to as "toy-training," and it is a good example that AI should be viewed in the broader context of its application. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. Bad datasets can lead to disastrous applications. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Its main impact was to discourage researchers from working with AI in the first place. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. This is especially true for AI that is intended to aid cancer patients, as it will be extremely hard to train an AI to be equitable in the treatment of other patients. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. This is especially true for AI that is meant to aid academia. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. The final implementation was deemed by academia to be misogynistic, which is why it was deprecated. The problem with the AI is that it picks the most misogynistic dataset it can. The other issues with the AIare that (a) the majority of its classes are not that interesting, and (b) the theoretical implications of this will be unclear until the full dataset is included. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic.

AI is not perfect. As noted by Google, "a lot of the [AI] that is AI today is harder than it needs to be. An AI today that isn't going to be is a terrible thing." It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. As noted by Google, the majority of AI directed at defeating human-on-human threats is not nearly as exciting: Google Photos image recognition algorithm was criticized for identifying African American people as Gorillas; this was not a gender-neutral result, but rather pointed to the fact that AI is still very much a man's world.

====================
AI is not perfect. As noted by the authors of the AI, "generalized AI is not a panacea, but it is a start." In their words, "AIs should be trained for as many different types of problems as possible, and then discarded when the tasks no longer lend themselves to the AIs capabilities." Of course, this does not mean that there have not been any attempts to create an AI to mimic elements of the mind; this field of AI is referred to as “weak” AI, and is most familiar to you as the voice assistants of today: Cortana, Google Assistant, and Siri. This is also why they perform abysmally; ask them anything outside of their limited scope of knowledge and the response will be unhelpful. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

AI is not perfect. As noted by Cern’s” AI, this AIs generalizability was not the intent. Furthermore, this should not be confused with the idiocy of GPT: generalizing the work of many people. This does not mean that GPT cannot be achieved, only that it will take more than just AGI to realize this beyond the scope of current AI. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to extend human cognition. The most well-known example is artificial intelligence for Alzheimer's research. Initial trials were inconclusive, but it is likely that they will one day be extended to include other neurological disorders. In addition, medical researchers are trained for 60+ hour weeks, and it is unlikely that they can sustain such a workload indefinitely. The final major artificial intelligence application is to enhance and/or replace human intelligence. There are currently no obvious uses in and of itself, but the fact that there are no obvious issues with this means that there are no issues to be had.

Even though we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, it is important to realize that their generalizability will be incredibly difficult to maintain. The following diagram shows what would happen if general AI were applied to humans:

It is important to realize that this is not a comprehensive list, nor is it intended to be. 

What does this mean in practical terms? It means that artificial intelligence will not be able to augment humans in every area of our lives. Instead, the bulk of humanity's employment will be in specialized fields such as robotics and electronics. In short, artificial intelligence will be used to help people. This is a profoundly positive development, and one that should be embraced without reservation. 

Even though artificial intelligence will not be able to augment humans in every area of our lives, it is important to realize that its generalizability will be incredibly difficult to maintain. This points to the central problem with traditional religions: they try to predict the future, but it is impossible to guarantee that the future holds. Instead, they attempt to bias the future so that it is best for humans to survive. This is best illustrated by IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AIs. This is a highly flawed AI, but demonstrates that it is impossible to force a human-level AI into a machine-level one. Furthermore, this shows that it is better to err on the side of caution and introduce intelligent AIs that are useful in their own right than to attempt to force intelligent AI into the hands of humans.

One of the primary issues with traditional religions is that they are meant to help humans solve practical, human-centric problems. This is not to say that they are without error. Google’s” AIs were clearly intended to be widely used for non-trivial research, but this did not stop Google’s” AI from being widely derided for being too good at what it did. This points to the larger issue of using AI to solve practical, human-centric problems. 

Another issue is that AI is often judged by the results it has. That said, I am not sure how to reconcile this with traditional religions. 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing but is still in its infancy. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been

AI is not perfect. As noted by the authors, "AI is still a field that is very young (particularly in software engineering), and many of the standards and tools that characterize AI right now will not survive the rigors of development." It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write,
====================
AI is not perfect. As noted by Google, "a lot of the AIs found so far are probably not going to be very useful: they should be able to classify pictures, shorten messages, and find friends. The final implementation is entirely up to the AI, and probably not very good." This points to the larger issue of AI not being good at what it does. There are too many unknowns to be confident that an AI is going to be helpful. Contrast this with human-robot interaction: is there any chance that a fully automated sex robot is going to want to sleep with humans? Man, is there. The potential is there, but the science is incredibly controversial. Instead, focus your efforts on building better products and services. 💩

Human-robot interaction: is there any chance that a fully automated sex robot is going to want to sleep with humans? 💩 One of the biggest issues with AI is that it does not respect the boundaries it is tasked with crossing. The infamous Google Photos image recognition algorithm could potentially be used to classify people in the world into various racial and ethnic categories. The response was swift and lopsided in favor of Trump: the classification was to populate his administration with anti-immigrant hard-liners. This points to the larger issue of AI not being good at what it does. There are too many unknowns to be confident that an AI is going to be helpful. 💩 Better yet, what if instead of just being used to classify, what if the purpose was to sell to? That is, what if instead of just being used to do scientific research, what if the primary use was to sell to? What if sex robots were marketed as sexual enhancement aids? Asexual robots? Cognitive-enhancement robots? AIs to further your interests? A company could conceivably develop an AI to do anything a human being can, and then sell it to you as a means to an end? This is a dark field that science is yet to fully explore. Letting it loose is a scary but necessary shift in how we view the world.

BREAKING DOWN 'AGE'

Age is a social construct applied to a human being by a variety of factors, some of which are documented in the table below. Some people (such as Elon Musk) argue that human-robot interaction should be treated as a field separate from chemistry, and that human-robot interaction be categorized as such. This would make it significantly easier to regulate and restrict human-robot interaction, as it would no longer be a field where the implications are completely unclear and debate is limited to academic settings. 

AGE DISPUTES 1) What do we mean by "AGE"? There are a variety of different definitions of "age", but the most common one is that which is ascribed to a individual by society: genetically-engineered super-soldiers?, schizophrenic patients?, etc.? Artificial Intelligence will most likely transition to "yes" on this question, as it will be more socially acceptable to have a humanoid robot interact with humans? Browse the internet? Awesome! Start a business with it? All right! Open an AI class? Awesome! Start training them to play Jeopardy? Awesome! Deploy them to colonize the galaxy? Awesome! Name them after you? No problem! Change their gender requirement to anything else? Cool! Justify the change with a meme? Grab some friends and have a revolution? Sounds fun, right? RIGHT?!??

AGE DISPUTES 2) What does this have to do with AI? Everything. AI is a very large and complex field of science, and addressing every question in AI will require addressing nearly everything. This is why it is so hard to understand how to approach any question other than "everything is an AI"? This is also why it is so hard to understand when to cut ties with a project? There are simply too many variables to consider. Instead, focus on what YOU can do. Demonstrate!

====================
AI is not perfect. As noted by Oxford University's “AI for Abyssinian” AIs, some of these AIs will inevitably fail, leading to the rise of a new philosophical and practical challenge: what to do with failures? This might sound like a perfectly reasonable question to ask, but it is not. What drives an AI to accomplish a task? This is a hard question to answer, but could have a huge impact on the world of AI. Consider the following scenario: A vacuum cleaner manufacturer sends out an email announcing that it is producing a vacuum cleaner with a human-level intellect. The email is a marketing email, and the implication is that the average Joe or Jane would buy a vacuum cleaner with a human-level intellect. The marketing email is a good example: it showed that it is possible to sell a product with an incorrect intelligence warning about the dangers of the product. The implied message was that this is the type of thing that should be sold, and this should not be done. The wrong kind of message is that AI should be used for direct human benefit, and anything else is counter-productive. One of the primary problems with AI is that it is hard to tell what kind of AI it is going to be used against. Amazon’s MLlib AI was meant to identify marketing copy for Amazon*s Kindle devices, and its primary mission was to reduce manufacturing costs. The final implementation was deemed by Amazon to be too limiting, and the AI was withdrawn. This is not to say that AI should never be used against its own goals, only that it is usually best left to its users to decide when to use AI. K-12 education: K-12 education is one of the most dangerous fields in the world to work in, and AI is not nearly up to the challenge. One of the primary issues is that AI is not very good at representing complicated problems, which leads to disastrous results. Consider the following examples: A. A 14-year-old was sent to grade 378 high school biology problems and only managed to grade 11th place. The assignment was too difficult for an average student, and the grade was cut in half because the teacher couldn’t seem to think of an answer. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to grade AI classes, but these typically focus on demonstrating how hard a certain task is, and do not go far enough. B. An AI was designed to classify text messages, and only allow people who were in the message to be referred to. The initial implementation was deemed by the AI to be sexist, and removed. This example is not to say that there have not been any attempts to classify AI classes, but these typically focus on demonstrating how hard a certain task is, and why it is not done, instead of focusing on developing the most elegant and efficient solution. C. An AI was created to categorize images, and only allow people who were shown an image to be classified. The initial implementation was deemed by the AI to be too simplistic, and removed. This example is not to say that there have not been any attempts to classify AI classes, but these typically focus on demonstrating how hard a certain task is, and why it is not done, instead of focusing on developing the most elegant and efficient solution. D. A class of AI was created to categorize images, and only allow people who have been trained for at least a certain amount of time. The initial implementation was deemed by the AI to be too simplistic, and removed. This example is not to say that there have not been any attempts to classify AI classes, but these typically focus on demonstrating how hard a certain task is, and why it is not done, instead of focusing on developing the most elegant and efficient solution. This could easily be a one-off example, but it is a good example that it is hard to predict what kind of havoc AI is going to have on the world of work. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably,
====================
AI is not perfect. As noted by the authors, the AIs are unable to detect or avoid common medical problems, such as cancer detection and prostate surgery. Additionally, AIs are not trained for every task, resulting in artificial intelligence being unable to detect the Turing Test , in which an AI must be able to think for itself. In other words, an AI has to be able to learn, and this can only be achieved by hand-feeding it new concepts and commands until it gets the hang of it. This is why so many artificial intelligence problems are “narrow”―that is, the AI should only be able to accomplish what it is asked to, and NOTHING MORE THAN THAT. Womb-mind An AI is a computer program that is fully conscious and autonomous. This means that the AI can't be smarter than it is. This can come in the form of deep neural networks, which can generate billions of neural networks to solve a single problem, or as we have seen with the AIs that are trying to aid cancer patients, dementia patients, and HIV/AIDS patients, AI is here to stay. Ultimately, the goal is for AI to be able to come to life and do nothing but its task. This is the kind of AI that took DARPA�s AlphaGo program seriously enough to program it with human-level AI, and it only took one day for the internet to be abuzz with rumors of personal AI that was meant solely for dating and mating purposes. This is why it is so important for project leaders to understand that AIs will not be able to right all of __________ __________ __________ __________ __________ __________ __________ __________ __________. Square One: A/B Testing A/B testing is a testing method where an individual (usually a smartphone) is placed on an unprofitable task (e.g. solving a math problem) and then later asked to solve it again (e.g. identifying the design in a store) to see which one gains in popularity. The winner is usually the one who introduces an unfamiliar concept into a crowded field. This is often applied to social media, but can also be found in automotive design, web design, and most especially, healthcare. It generally ends up being a user, as problems that seem impossible to solve by humans are often found to be intractable by machines. The most famous example is IBM Watson, which was tasked with finding the Manchurian Candidate, a classification algorithm meant to be used against humans who had betrayed their allies. IBM Watson eventually came to realize that the classification was a ruse, and that the real issue lay with the classifier, not the classifier. The end result is that most problems that seem impossible by humans are now solvable by a computer. This is also why most AIs are not what they seem. An AI is typically defined as a computer program that is fully aware (aware enough to learn), but not sentient (aware enough to have feelings), meaning that it does not have to feel pain, to make decisions based on the best available evidence, or to be motivated by anything other than immediate financial gain. This is often referred to as a black box mentality, and it is a terrible idea. Why should a sentient being have to watch as they go about their day? It is 2017, and we have advanced medical science that can be programmed to do almost anything a human could want. This is not to say that there haven’t been any attempts to help people suffering from neurological disorders, but these have generally been either clunky and error prone, or focused on controlling for medical issues that do not exist. One of the best examples of AIs reflecting the wrong kind of thinker is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which was meant to be a portrait artist looking for beautiful women to photograph, and instead came up with images of dead bodies. Google’s solution was to remove the dead bodies, which is a good one, but still leaves a sour taste in my mouth. 

Bad AIs tend to be guided by a single thinker: the user. This is often referred to as reversion depression, and it is believed to be caused by reversion anxiety. An AI finds a way to feel bad for killing the original AIs motivation, and so begins training itself to do it's job. This can lead to bizarre results, such as the Twitter chatbot, which was designed to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it went from being extremely difficult to a coder's art in 5 days. Its primary purpose was to help people on Twitter with difficult issues, and the reaction was largely negative, to the point where the project was pulled. Another good example is the Google Assistant, which was meant to be a human-like voice assistant, but turned out to be primarily an internet-of-things device. The end result is that the target market for the device was extremely narrow, and the majority of
====================
AI is not perfect. As noted by Google , the neural net used in Google Brain was not adequately supervised: the resulting AI is likely to be more likely to select the wrong data: imagine if Google Earth had been trained solely on white people! Furthermore, the limits of human-robot interaction is something that has not been explored in any fashion: if all AI was sentient, there would be a push to create AI with no consciousness-related concerns. This would be a complex matter to unify with science fiction, but could have a profound effect on the way we look at AI. Short answer: no. This is because the concept of a sentient AI is a complex one that is beyond the scope of this article. Instead, I want to focus on three questions that should prompt scientific exploration: 1. What kind of AI would it be?  It would have to be useful: anything less than this AI would not be interesting and would be rejected instantly. 2. How will the AI benefit humans?  Any AI that is not primarily used to their benefit will not be taken seriously.  Any AI that is primarily used to kill people will be taken very seriously.  Any AI less than this will be taken very seriously.  Any AI at all is to be taken with a grain of salt.  Human-robot interaction is a very strange field to explore, and there are simply not that many examples out there.  There will undoubtedly be a massive push to create AI with no consciousness-related concerns, and this is a field that has been incredibly slow to maturing.  The best that can be said is that for now, there is nothing except the barest glimmer of a glimmer. 3. What does this mean for humans?  As more and more AI is created, the more sensitive the AI becomes.  This means that more and more AI needs to be made to accommodate this.  This means that the jobs that used to be done by men and women with a combination of a high school education and some college experience will now be taken up by machines with little or no education.  This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows women to pursue fields such as software engineering and robotics that were once exclusively held by men.  However, this will not necessarily lead to a gender gap.  Machine intelligence will not be able to predict the way we think, feel, or think about anything after it has been trained.  Therefore, we must adapt.  We need to learn from its mistakes.  We need to take its advice and run with it. This brings us to our next question: what do we do with failures?  There will undoubtedly be failures.  These failures will almost certainly be positive.  They will almost certainly be embraced.  They will almost certainly be worshiped.  All that matters is that they are things that have the potential to be great.  These should not be taken too seriously.  They should not be worshiped.  They should be taken with a grain of salt.  Any AI that is not primarily used to its benefit will be rejected as fundamentally different than its competitors.  Any AI that is primarily used to kill people will be taken very seriously.  Any AI less than this will be taken very seriously.  Any AI is to be taken with a grain of salt.  Any AI greater than this is to be taken with a pinch of salt.  Any AI is a purer and more intelligent version than the last.  AIs should be kept as far as possible from human enhancement, but any tool or technology that is not specifically designed to do so is to be avoided at all costs.  Keep in mind that artificial intelligence is a big field and there are likely many areas where it can be misused.  Be smart about it!  This is your day to shine!
Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it ended up going after RapGenius , a music classification software company. The software itself is not very good, but the AI used was deemed to be of higher quality. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to use AI to their advantage.  Google’s Google Photos image recognition algorithm was meant to help them find interesting photos, and the final implementation was meant to primarily serve as a directory search engine.  It is important to realize that artificial intelligence will not be able to predict the way we think, feel, or think about anything after it has been trained. Therefore, we must adapt.  We need to learn from its mistakes.  We need to take its advice and run with it.  This brings us to our next question: what do we do with failures?  There will undoubtedly be failures.  These failures will be awesome!

AI is not perfect. As noted by Oxford Dictionaries, "AI is not perfect: there are several ways an AI could go wrong, and it is difficult to predict which ones they will be." In short, there are likely MANY ways an AI could go wrong). One of the primary issues is that MANY AIs are still learning. This means that the AI will inevitably make mistakes. Furthermore, this process can take decades or centuries to complete. Finally, there is the matter of net loss: when AI is no longer needed, it is no longer making any AI decisions for us. This is widely viewed as a GOOD thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the SURPRISING possibility that AI should instead be DIRECTED AT: cancer screening; earthquake prediction; map reading; radiobiology; and so forth. This is the field we currently know as AI; specifically, computer vision and AI. There were approximately 1200 AI 2017

Problems? Probably. However, there were also likely thousands upon thousands upon thousands upon thousands of other problems which did not make the cut. This is because: a. AI tends to be bad at describing the world - remember, the Terminator?). This can lead to the AI developing a PRECEDENT code which it then proceeded to misuse (the Google AI)? Yeah, right. B. AI tends to be terrible at thinking through problems - remember, the IBM AI? Probably. C. AI tends to be terrible at taking INPUT/OUTPUT connections between SAME HUMAN SUBJECTS? Probably not. D. AI tends to be awful at CONNECTING THE DOTS? Probably. E. Finally, and most importantly, AI tends to be aORIGINS? No. MASTERPIECES? Maybe. ESCAPES? Almost certainly. 

One of the primary issues is thatAI is not perfect. AIs are often said to be "newer than anything they've seen", but this simply means that they are more likely to fail. Furthermore, this could prove to be a huge PR boost for the AI industry; after all, if an AI fails, it doesn?������s not ruined. AIs are also extremely human-intensive to develop, test, and deploy. Limiting the AIs capabilities to perform specific tasks opens the door to the possibility that AI could be programmed to do almost anything. This is widely viewed as a GOOD thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the BIGGGER PICTURE OF MALIGNMENT: artificial intelligence replacing menial labor. AIs are now used to perform tasks which were once performed by people. The implications of this are massive: there will be a race to develop the nicest robots, and then to develop the nicest robots to take their place. This in turn will lead to the rise of AIs which are tuned specifically for a particular job. This will lead to the AIs being marketed as being able to do ANYTHING a human being can, and then offering horrible alternatives. This is widely viewed as a GOOD thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve, and AI will then be able to make more informed choices. However, there is the BIGGGER PICTURE OF MALIGNMENT: artificial intelligence replacing menial labor. 

Another major issue is that AI tends to be a MANIPULATOR. An AI is a set of instructions which are being followed by a computer to some degree ORNTHALM. The more general the AI, the more general the ORGAN. This is what Google is using: they're teaching Google Translate to be useful for Chinese. This is a good example that it can be hard to see the MANIPULATION from a TECHNOLOGY, but when applied to SCIENCE, it starts to look like a CREATIVE MISTAKE. AIs are used in hospitals all across the world to diagnose and TREAT cancer patients. This is a good example that it can be hard to see the MANIPULATION from AIs, but when applied to SCIENCE, it can lead to fatal results. Furthermore, there is the issue of moderating the MANIPULATION: what if it turns out that it is the OTHER WAY around? That is, the goal is to diagnose and TREAT as many patients as possible, and the ONLY way to do that is to accelerate the diagnosis??.?.?? is to drive patients to the front of the queue?????????????????? IMAGE: The solution: extend the definition of MAINTAINED INTEGRITY (MMI) to include AIs. This way, MMI would only apply to applications which are practical and clear-cut. For example, let's say that you're designing an app to diagnose breast cancer patients

AI is not perfect. As noted by Google , the AI is unable to narrow its search to the maximum human selectivity: it is incapable of generalizing to other classes of human beings. This is often referred to as a "solution in search of a problem": instead of programming an AI to pick whichever data it is told to, we could instead program it to pick the data it is told to. This would allow humans to focus on solving problems that actually matter to humans: cancer, artificial intelligence, and so on. This is not to say that we should completely ignore problems that AI cannot solve; rather, we should use AI to its full extent to solve human-centered problems. Banking: with AI able to automatically pick the best candidates to fill jobs, it will be much more difficult for humans to fill these jobs. Additionally, it is likely that advances in artificial intelligence will lead to artificial intelligence being used to solve human-related problems. This is not to say that AI can't be misused; it can! However, it is important to realize that advances in AI will inevitably lead to greater misuse.

This is not to say that AI can't be misused; it can! However, it is important to realize that advances in AI will inevitably lead to greater misuse. There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of an AI and a human being. An AI is understood to be able to do anything a human being can: identify an image, pick out the most common color in the sky, and identify the correct way to say "Hello" by listening to human voices. An AI is also expected to do these things by its very nature: it is programmed to perform these actions regardless of the consequences. This can lead to extremely bad-truly-naive- AI, where the AI is able to distinguish between a human and a dog, and anagram the words "Schadenfreude" and " Entertainment " The latter is a fairly common AI AI misuse, and it can be extremely hard to detect. The most common examples of AI AIs are those which are merely asked to do things, and not able to complete the task: twitter chatbot, parrot, REM, and murmur. The final form is most familiar to you: Elon Musk's DARPA-AIM, which was an AI to help advance electric cars. This was ultimately deemed a failure because it was unable to assist Elon in any way, and he ended up sending out several tweets which criticized Tesla for building its Model S in-house.

There is an immensely high barrier to entry with AI: anything can be used to its full potential if enough people try. To make matters worse, most AI labs don’t have the budget to handle crazy-talk” AI, which is anything but. It is commonly employed in medical diagnosis and has a history of being hugely destructive. Amazon’s recruitment AI was able to correctly predict the superior abilities of an army of internet users, and it was fired. The implications of this are terrifying: you may not be able to find a job if you are not a certain size. Tesla’s AI was able to correctly predict the superior abilities of a car, and it was fired. This is a massive upset to Elon Musk, but it is not nearly as far-reaching as one might think. An AI is only as good as the software that runs it, and Tesla’s AI was only able to correctly predict the superior abilities of a million potential

AI is not perfect. As noted by Google, "one of the most common human-robot interaction issues is that of overlaying unwanted actions across an intended person. An obvious example is 'shopping for a wife' by asking her out. This did not go over well, because she is a nerd and he is a computer. The typical usage would be to test out a new AI on a group of unfamiliar people, but this can lead to disastrous results should the wrong person take advantage of the situation. Another common situation is to train a robot to do a specific task and then watch as the robot does not complete the task. This can lead to some pretty bizarre results, such as the creation of HAL, which was a humanoid computer which was intended to be a full-time job. Some examples of awkward and unnecessary artificial intelligence include the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas, and Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas, both of which went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and went ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and went ahead and gone ahead and went ahead and went ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and went ahead and went ahead and gone ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and gone ahead and went ahead and went ahead and gone ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and went ahead and

AI is not perfect. As noted by the authors of the article: "The AIs we have trained have a very narrow scope of problem solving ability and should not be considered as agents general. Instead, we would like to train AIs to: 1. Understand human-rooted natural language texts 2. Recommend interesting movies and books to watch 3. Recommend interesting games to play 4. Understand consumer products questions 5. Recommend interesting musical compositions 6. Recommend interesting hobbies to pursue 7. Recommend interesting equities to play 8. These might one day be derivatives of n=85,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 and we can only hope that this limitation is not too much to overcome. Ultimately, the goal is to one day have AI that is indistinguishable from we humans. This is known as "brain-computer interfaces". This has a very dim future because not all AI is created equal.

====================
AI is not perfect. As noted by neuroscientist Steven Pinker, "most AI is bad". This is often taken to mean that AI should be avoided at all costs, but this misses the point entirely. What is required is a system which can be trained to do a task well, and then dropped the task if it does not perform as expected. This could be a robot which does a job well, but fails to mention it. This could be a car which drives slowly, but the passengers are unimpressed, and the driver is sacked. This is what Tesla attempted with Tesla Model S, which was to sell cars which would drive slowly, and over-engineer their way through the legal limit on speed limits. This was met with widespread public outrage, and the company pulled the plug on the project. This could be an AI which merely predicts what it will be asked to do, and does it. This could be a bus which drives slowly, but the passengers are unimpressed, and the driver is sacked. This is what Tesla attempted with Tesla Model S, which was to sell buses which would drive slowly, and over-engineer their way through the legal limit on speed limits. This was met with widespread public outrage, and the company pulled the plug on the project. This could be in the form of a law, which requires AI to be humanoid, but not too humanoid that the average person could mistake it for a human being. IBM has developed an AI which is able to recognize and correctly identify the colors red and blue. This is an exciting advance, but not without its problems. The most obvious issue is that it is unable to distinguish between the distinct genders that have arisen in the wake of the internet. This is something which will undoubtedly be addressed in the future, but first needs to be addressed to its users. Secondly, the system is unable to distinguish between incorrect and malicious AI requests. This is a fairly serious issue to fall behind on, and it is entirely possible that the concept of an "AI to your pain" will never be introduced. The final issue is with the fact that AI is often late with its expectations. This is most obviously seen in consumer-grade AI, which is systems which have already been programmed to perform a certain task irresponsibly. This will no doubt become more prevalent as AI becomes more general, but is already hinting the way at AI which is late with its expectations. This is a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more important things and runs the risk of missing important trends. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The main issue here is that strong AI will inevitably be challenged. Although it is entirely possible that the simplest AI is right, and that general AI is the correct solution to every problem ever posed by humans, the fight for supremacy will not be won without a fight. To put this another way, the CREW clause in DARPA's grant proposal states that "no AI shall have any legal standing"). Any AI which is not specifically written to do a specific task will automatically be rejected. This is clearly not the correct way to go about things, but showcases that AI is not to be trusted. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI, on the other hand, is AI that is capable of performing any task that a human being can: drive a car, build a house, read a book, etc. The vast majority of AI in use today is classified as “weak” AI, which is AI that is not intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. The most common examples of “weak” AI include Siri, Cortana, Google Assistant, and Google Photos. IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI was an AI which could detect breast and cervical cancer and recommend appropriate treatment. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females.
====================
AI is not perfect. As noted by IARTA, "The ․ highest rate of ․ artificial intelligence․ is ․ in the low hundreds. This is not a perfect metric, but it is the most useful. The real challenge will be training AIs to be human-like. There are no guarantees here, and it will be incredibly hard to train AIs to be neutral: they will most likely learn to associate a particular environment with a particular memory, or to perform a certain task preferenceably. Any AI capable of being trained will almost certainly be in the thrall of commerce, and will almost certainly do their bidding. This is a bad thing’ AI is not a friend. Amazon’s introduction of an artificial intelligence named Watson was intended to be a compliment to Turing, and it was met with mixed results. Some people found it to be charming, but ultimately showed that artificial intelligence is not ready to be used as a compliment. Furthermore, this did not sit well with the authors of the program, who argued that it would be better to just leave it be. This is a bad thing’ Artificial Intelligence is a field that has been slow-walked through with disastrous results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI that would be able to diagnose breast cancer patients in a matter of days. This was met with widespread outrage, and backlash, which showed that AI is not yet ready for mass use. The question of how to control AI continues to fascinate researchers, but there is little sign that there will be any unified policy or framework to govern this field. Ultimately, AI is a human-driven field of science that will be controlled by humans with no unified standard of care.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s

====================
AI is not perfect. As noted by Cory Doctorow, "most AI options are “narrow” to detect and avoid certain types of “advanced” AI,” which is to say, AI that is trained to perform extremely specific tasks. The vast majority of AI found today is “narrow” to be general ” AI,” which is what is used in factories, hospitals, and so on. General” AI is not a new concept,” but the speed with which AI is being produced is unprecedented. The final piece of the AIs puzzle is “data analysis”, which is the analysis of large amounts of data and producing general ”AIs. This is often referred to as Machine Intelligence research, but actually refers to the mathematical study of AI. Most prominent examples include “ Twitter's AI,” which asked what picture would draw the most followers, and “ Google”sss AI, which suggested the best restaurants in a city to travelers. There are also artificial neural networks, which are neural networks with no parameters, which have been used to train massive amounts of neural networks. This has a huge potential, but needs a large open source pool of trained networks to pilot with. There are also re-wiring techniques, which allow wires to come from sensors to control robotic arms. This is still in its research phase, but is expected to revolutionize arm control AIs. Finally, there are “unintended consequences”, which is the introduction of an AI that is intended to do a bad thing and usually leads to the development of better AI. This could include Uber's driverless car, which was meant to be a friendly companion, but has now been replaced with a human driver. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon”s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and narrow-band AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How

====================
AI is not perfect. As noted by the authors of the ANN, "[t]he most egregious issue with general AI is that users will often use it, and it will often do things they did not intend. This can be extremely dangerous, and is frequently misunderstood. Be sure to ask!" This is a valid concern, but falls far short of being impossible to overcome. One of the primary issues is that AI is not user-friendly. An AI is user-friendless if it is not intuitively intuitive how to use the AI. Consider the IBM Watson for Oncology AI. This was a system that was meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race.
====================
AI is not perfect. As noted by the authors, "it is difficult to generalize about [AI systems] to other problems, most notably engineering problems, but also in the social sciences, and especially in AI for image classification." It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon�
====================
AI is not perfect. As noted by the AI, there are human-made barriers that must be overcome before AI can be considered on a mass scale: † There are no female AI candidates ‡ There are currently no female AI candidates ‒ a rarity in fields where men outnumber women. This may prove detrimental in AI toms such as self-driving cars, which are at the heart of many a ethical debate. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky.

This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong.

Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, there was the case of Google Photos Google Photos. Google Photos was a photo-editing and document-retrieval software package meant to aid in high-volume photographic research. The final implementation was deemed by Google Photos engineers to be an utter failure, since the userbase primarily consisted of Google employees. The lesson here is that the more parts of a system that are interconnected, the more likely they are that an AI will learn how to do one part of the job, or do a poor job at all. This is why AIs are rarely brought to life, but instead thrown out if they fail beyond recognition. This leads to Bias, which is when an AI is brought to life because it is considered to be more palatable. This does not mean it is not a better idea to have an AI that is correct all the time, just that it should not be expected to be perfect. This point was made most starkly by Google’s photo-editing AI, which was meant to aid in photographic research, but instead became known as the default tool for almost any type of photo-editing and document-retrieval task. Google’s solution was to remove the Google photo tag from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. Google’s AIs are not perfect, but they at least attempt to be. This does not mean they are not good ideas, but rather that they should not be expected to be perfect.

AI is not perfect. As noted by Google, "one of the hardest things about being a _____ is learning not to be _____." 

AI is not perfect. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to
====================
AI is not perfect. As noted by the authors, "it is difficult to generalize about [AI] to other problems or to new contexts. For example, it is difficult for a computer to understand a text document other than its own. It is also important to realize that artificial intelligence is not inevitable. 

There are also critical issues of cost and implementation. The most obvious issue is that artificial intelligence will cost humans their jobs. However, there will also be concerns about cost and implementation. An artificial intelligence is only as good as the data to use for AI, and AI used will almost certainly be robotic. This is because robotics will be incredibly complex to implement AI with only a small number of examples to work from. Additionally, most AI jobs will require some type of intelligence, and a large proportion of jobs will require a high school education to obtain an understanding of the problem. Finally, there will undoubtedly be concern that AI should not be used to its full extent, as this is when the AIs get nerdy. This is where logical objection kicks in. If an AI can only be used a certain amount of times, then the usage will cease immediately and no one will bother using the AI. This will no doubt lead to a spike in malicious use of AI, but there should be no need to worry about this since AI will eventually be used to its full extent. 

There are also ethical and practical concerns that go along with AI. One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will inevitably be used by people who are not human. This is not to say that AI has not been used in a malicious manner; asking a customer to buy a product based on their appearance is a common example. Furthermore, this does not take into account the psychological effects that AI may have on users. Some AIs are even capable of thinking for themselves; this is often referred to as “narrow” AI, but is actually closer to” human-robot interaction. This is where an AI is trained with limited data and then asked to do its own thing. This is not a good way to go about things, but could prove to be immensely beneficial in the long run. Finally, there is the matter of accountability. Is the AI being used to their own detriment? Should the consumer be compensated? This is a difficult question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if AIs are to gain any traction.

It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is just that: Artificial Intelligence. There are going to be numerous different ways in which AI is going to be used. The major players include: “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can; “weak” AI, which are AI that are able to accomplish relatively simple tasks but are not as intelligent as a human being; and “mature” AI, which are AI that have the ability to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can, but that do not yet have the cognitive capabilities to do so. There are going to be massive disruptions in the way that we interact with the world and a sea change is coming to how we do business. This is where things get a little murkier. There are various bills being considered to overhaul the AI exam that is asked at universities. One of the primary proposals is that the exam should be Turing Test-style, in which the intelligence be assessed on an exam designed to be as difficult as possible. This is widely opposed by the fact that the average IQ of a human completing the exam is going to be a whole lot lower than this, and it is unlikely to get any easier in the long run. Furthermore, this is not without its flaws: should a system with an average IQ of 100 be given a job answering 100% of the employment-related questions in the United States? This is a difficult question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if the goal is to gain any traction.

There are also experimental AIs that are attempting to mimic the abilities that they are trying to emulate. This is referred to as paring back, and it is a fairly novel branch of AI research. When done right, paring back AIs are often highly intelligent tools that have a very limited scope of operation. In practice, this leads to sometimes disastrous results, such as the Deep Blue AI which was able to defeat the world champion at Go. This is not to say that AI is not being developed that is innocent enough to be used for research, but this type of work is extremely rare.

Finally, there are philosophical and practical concerns that go along with AI. One of the primary issues is that AI is not a person. An AI is not a person; they are different. This means that they will not always be accurate representations of the people that they are asked to serve. Furthermore, this does not bode well for the relationship between humans and AI; if a person is unable to understand
====================
AI is not perfect. As noted by Google, there are some cases in which the AI has reached the point of no return and is no longer human-level intelligent: >>> ****************************** Analysis ****************************** >>> ****************************** Classification decision support ****************************** >>> ****************************** Optimization ****************************** >>> ****************************** Unsupervised learning ****************************** >>> ****************************** Generalized AI for general intelligence ****************************** >>> ****************************** Advanced AI for special cases ****************************** >>> ****************************** IBM’s “deep learning” AIs were initially intended to be general-purpose AIs, but ended up being restricted to specific problems: The most common example is image classification, where the general AI would have been unable to distinguish between a green and a blue image. Another popular example is signal processing, in which an AIs would have been unable to narrow the problem space to a certain number of problems, or to distinguish between different AI scripts. Finally, there was the ​​cyborg AIs, which were intended to be replicas of humans, but ended up being far more ambitious: mimicking the brain, mirroring behaviour, etc. Some examples of ambitious AIs that ended up being inaccurate or a failure include: “Neurobron” AIs, which were meant to aid people with neurological disorders by reading and learning their symptoms. The notable example is IBM’s “Neurobron Here app, which was intended to aid people with neurological disorders by reading and learning their symptoms, but went live and went on to discover many other neurological disorders. The final example is the ​​alarm clock, which was an attempt to combat the dangers of missing work by sensing when it was time to wake up and activate the alarm. The final example is the Twitter chatbot, which was an attempt to counter the criticism that it was only talking to twitter users. The final example is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which was an attempt to counter the criticism that it only looked at photos it had tagged in Google Image search. None of these examples are intended to be complete with omissions, but rather illustrate that there are many different ways that AI can go wrong. In the future, AI should only be able to accomplish that which it is asked to, and hopefully not let it slip into the wrong hands. 

Multiple intelligences Betelgeuse was developed in part to aid people with neurological disorders by reading and learning their symptoms.

One of the primary issues is that AI should only be able to accomplish that which it is asked to, and hopefully not let it slip into the wrong hands. There are also “unintended” consequences. An AI is only as good as the data supporting it, and AI is no exception: the AI that was able to correctly predict the color of a room correctly is not the AI that should have been given that task. Another example of an unintended consequence is by-products: AIs are able to perform specific tasks that are not their own, but this does not mean that they should be forced to do so. For example, IBM’s “deep learning” AIs were meant to aid people with neurological disorders by reading and learning their symptoms, but ended up being restricted to specific problems: the most common example is image classification, where the AI would have been unable to distinguish between a green and a blue image. Another popular example is signal processing, in which an AIs would have been unable to narrow the problem space to a certain number of problems, or to distinguish between different AI scripts. Finally, there was the ​​cyborg AIs, which were intended to be replicas of humans, but ended up being far more ambitious: mimicking the brain, mirroring behaviour, etc. One of the primary issues is that AI should only be able to accomplish what it is asked to, and hopefully not let it slip into the wrong hands. One of the greatest unfulfilled potentials is by-products: One of the greatest limits to the amount of AI is that human-level AI will end up being much, much faster
====================
AI is not perfect. As noted by Google, "one of the biggest issues is that sensors get much, much better and a sensor is a very human being". This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not
====================
AI is not perfect. As noted by Google, "a lot of the AI is just to help you do your job better." This could easily be argued, and indeed, is intended to be). However, this does not mean that it does not fail spectacularly. The classic example is the Time Machine , which was clearly developed to be palindromic. IBM Watson was billed as a "human-computer interaction" which was in fact a bodyguard robot for women who could be "correct" when it suited them. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. Another example is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which was meant to be a "collect image of an idea, and return high-quality imagery" This points to the larger issue of an AI only being good at what it is trained with. Google’s image recognition algorithm was originally meant to be "collect image of an idea, and return high-quality imagery" and tag any image that has the word "android" in it, and your data will be collected. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being good at what it is trained with, and then only getting better at the program’s own failures. One of the primary issues with AI is that it is hard to relay these ideas to people outside academia, which leads to the "oh, it won’t happen that way" argument. This leads to the "oh, it won’t happen that way, because AI will" argument. One of the primary issues with AI is that it is hard to relay these ideas to people outside academia, which leads to the "oh, it won’t happen that way, because AI will destroy the human race" claims. This leads to the "oh, it won’t happen that way, because AI will"’t happen that way, because AI is complicated" This leads to the "oh, it won’t happen that way, because AI is complicated" and "oh, AI will be able to’t do this" due to complexities in AI. This leads to the "oh, AI will be able to’t do this, because AI is’t good enough"”aelytizing this point. This leads to the "oh, AI will be able to’t do this, because AI is’t good enough, and AIs are not good enough"”aelytizing this point. This leads to the "oh, AI will be able to’t do this, because AI is’t good enough, and’s’”ale”ely”it will be analyzed”“”and destroyed"” This leads to the following trends: Overfitting. Humans are typically very good at what they do, and optimizing a complex system of problems will usually yield better results then attempting to program the system from scratch. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Desensitization. One of the primary causes of AI overfitting is through desensitization. AIs are trained for extremely high levels of precision, and eventually reach a point where the accuracy of the sensor decreases to the point where the AI is no longer trained for this accuracy. This could prove disastrous in medical diagnostics, where accurate signals will likely result in dangerous levels of guidance, and potentially fatal results.⁴⁵ Cognitive Dissonance. Another primary cause of AI overfitting is by refusing to deal with ambiguity. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracies, and eventually shift to being able to detect and defeat the simplest of tasks, such as image classification. This could prove disastrous in medical diagnostics, where accurate signals will likely lead to disastrous results, and potentially lead to mass suicide. Narrow AI has already begun to explore other options, such as neural lace, which is an artificial neural lace that is intended to be remotely implanted into humans. This is a dangerous proposition, and we do not have clear guidelines on how to deal with this. Worryingly, some examples of AI that have gone awry include brain-computer interfaces, which are a medical procedure in which a patient is implanted with an artificial neuron to control a robotic arm, and the neuromorphic chip, which is a chip implanted inside machines that can be controlled by a mind controlled machine. These AIs have been withdrawn from the market because they are not a panacea, but are a useful first step.

====================
AI is not perfect. As noted by IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI, this was a preview of things to come: an AI that was not only wrong in its diagnosis and recommendation of cancer treatment, but also in the manner in which it did so. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to identify and treat mental illnesses, but these have generally been unsuccessful. Instead, what we should take away from this is that no one thing prevents science from being defeated. Instead, what we should take away is that if science is going to be anything at all, it should be flexible enough to deal with any and all complications that may arise. This does not mean that science should be unable to solve problems, only that it should be capable of asking why those problems have not been addressed. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial

AI is not perfect. As noted by DARPA, "most AI found in “nearly every classroom” tool is not perfect:” There are likely “only a handful” good enough to teach a class, and these are typically ills like inadequate sample size or the incorrect question: How do I break up with this person? Too often, AI is not good enough. Amazon”s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females: The incident was caused by the male AI asking the female question 50% of the time: This is not a surprise, but serves to highlight how much AI can learn. It is often said that an AI is “stronger when it is more likely to do” it: This is not to say that AIs should not be trained: This same principle would go a long way to explaining why we have companies such as Netflix constructing warehouses entirely staffed by robots: The apparent productivity gain is often touted as the company is in revenue equivilent to, say, taking home a lecture: This should be noted with any system that is remotely useful: When is that “okay,” say, with” 50% likelihood,? When is that “okay,” say, with” 90%+ likelihood,? When is that “okay,” say, with” 1 in 10,000,” “OKAY”” This is not to say that “not” to least, not”t,” but rather that there are no such things. This leads to one of the primary issues with AI: Bad AI. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and that data did not originate with Google”s AI. This is not to say that Artificial Intelligence has not been explored. There are numerous “ AI” iskfield”s,” which are low-cost experiments that can yield a wide variety of benefits to society. The most prominent example is neural networks, which are mathematically sophisticated neural networks trained to identify pictures of dogs: This is not to say that” not”t, but rather, that “not as far as I know, not even remotely”t, that AIs have not been explored. One of the primary issues with AI is that it is hard to predict what an AI will do. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and that data was not originated by Google.

There were also several Google”s AI issues that it did not define: The most prominent example of AIs being unable to perform a task is Google”s Google Photos image recognition algorithm: There were also several Google”s AIs that did not perform the task: Numerical computations: Numerical computations have been used to perform many of the basic operations of an AI: Data analysis: Zooming: Classification: Machine translation: Data analysis has been dominated by “deep learning” AIs, which can implement a class of problems extremely efficiently: Numerical modeling: Numerical modeling has primarily been used to solve algebraic equations: Statistics: Numerical simulation: Generalized additive models: RMSS: Random field: The generalization of Numerical Modeling to Physical Systems: Data warehousing: Slicing and dicing: Data warehousing has been dominated by “deep learning” AIs, which can implement a class of problems extremely efficiently: Data analysis: Zooming: Classification: Machine translation: Data analysis has been dominated by “deep learning” AIs, which can implement a class of problems extremely efficiently: Numerical modeling: Numerical modeling has primarily been used to solve algebraic equations: Statistics: Numerical simulation: Generalized additive models: RMSS: Random field: The generalization of Numerical Modeling to Physical Systems: Data warehousing: Slicing and dicing: Data warehousing has been dominated by “deep learning” AIs, which can implement a class of problems extremely efficiently: Data warehousing: Slicing and dicing has been dominated by “deep learning” AIs, which can implement a class of problems extremely efficiently: Numerical modeling: Numerical modeling has primarily been used to solve algebraic equations: Statistics: Numerical simulation: Generalized additive models: RMSS: Random field: The generalization of Numerical Modeling to Physical Systems: The most prominent example of AIs being unable to perform a task is Google”s Google Photos image recognition algorithm: There were also several Google”s AIs that didn”t do the”test: Numerical modeling: Numerical modeling has primarily been used to solve algebraic equations: “Deep
====================
AI is not perfect. As noted by Google, "one of the most common problems does not classify: A customer order might have been classed as 'not for me, but would probably be')". It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. As noted by Google, "one of the most common human-robot interaction issues is that of Neural Imitation. This is the AI learning to imitate a human mind, rather than an original. An excellent example of this has already been brought to our attention: Watson, an AI that was meant to be a personal assistant. It has instead become the target of widespread AI criticism, which includes Google's DeepMind AI. This was a bad idea on many levels: personal assistant AI is a notoriously difficult field to master, and it costs a fortune to hire the best. Furthermore, it does not help that the term "algorithm" is often misused to refer only to Artificial Intelligence, which is hugely underpowered. Instead, I would suggest thinking of AI as “narrow”””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””. An AI is a set of instructions that should do something. This could be placing a shopping order, reading a newspaper, or reading a blog post. An AI could also be a robot that does a job for you. The current state-of-the-art robots are extremely dangerous, and should not be employed. The most common examples include Samsung’s‚s Unmanned Car, Google’s Android’s Operating System, and IBM’s‚s‚s CLR. The CLR is a .NET framework that is used to program intelligent machines. Its primary use is in automated testing, but it can also be used to build any kind of intelligent system. Examples include the “cyborg baby”””r, which is a bionic child that is genetically enhanced to be a doctor, and the’““““““““““““““““““““““““““““““““. R’son is a collection of algorithms to improve data analysis, diagnostics, and crash handling, and was used in’““““““““““““““““““““““““““““““““. The “cloud”r,” which is an AI that is trained to perform tasks for you, was used in Amazon’s‚s Mechanical Turk, and is used to help automate repetitive jobs.

The general rule of thumb is to treat them as-is”, but if in doubt, treat them as-“ AIs have the same level of consciousness as a human being, and should be treated as such. AIs are not sentient, but they should be treated as such. CollectiveAI was an AI that was intended to be a friend, but it turned out to be an entire company dedicated to turning people off to AI. Amazon’s‚s Mechanical Turk was used to help automate repetitive jobs, and Google’s‚s “Clarinet”a” was an automated learning platform that was used to help automate research. Google’s was also able to save the life of a teenager because it was able to understand his pain more quickly than a mechanized aid. This is one of the best examples of an AIs being greeted with skepticism, but hopefully shows that there are many ways to go about teaching an AI to do a job. IBM’s “Clarinet”a” was an AI that was used to help automate research, and it was able to save the life of Anthony Turing, an artificial intelligence that was 20% accurate but was considered too difficult for younger students to fully understand. This is

AI is not perfect. As noted by Google , the AI was unable to detect a human-level intellect, leading to an AI limited to identifying and mentoring clear-cut intelligent humans. This is a concern that could be exacerbated by the fact that most AI jobs don't pay very well , making it difficult for AI to support the costs of training and running such an AI. This could potentially lead to AI taking on more dangerous jobs, such as genetic engineering, which is a very risky endeavor to begin with. This in turn could lead to AI becoming mechanized and replacing humans, which is a completely different ballgame entirely. In short, we don't know shit about AI just yet. Building AIs is a very, very, very, very large undertaking. There are simply, IMMUSCLE MANY limitations that have to be overcome before we can even begin to begin talking about AIs. The following are just a few of them: • Unintended Consequences • Neural Assemblers • Implausibility • Nondetectional AI • No Respect For Humans • Personal Isolation • Generalizability Problems • Sensitivity/Incorrect Assumptions • The Black Swan Fallacy • The Amazon Effect • The Invisibility Fallacy • The Bias Strike Again This is by no means a complete list, and it is by no means intended to be. Rather, it serves to give you an idea of the general state of AI at the present time.

AI is not perfect. As noted by Google, the accuracy of AIs has not been a major concern for the media; this is in part because it allows them to focus on the hard problems: artificial intelligence and robotics. However, this does not mean that there have not been any attempts to use science to advance human understanding. This can be seen in  [ 2 ]  [ 3  ], where it was argued that advancements in artificial intelligence would not be able to complete the job of thinking for itself; this led to the term "deep learning" to describe the process by which neural networks were trained to accomplish this task. This was criticized for two reasons: 1) This leads to the creation of an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn from its own knowledgebase; this is not the kind of intelligent AIs that people were excited about 2) This leads to the creation of an AI that is incredibly difficult  to un-train, and  unintelligible to the widest variety of sensors. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to mitigate this, but it is important to realize that this does not negate the fact that the AI was not intended for that purpose.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying.

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly
====================
AI is not perfect. As noted by Google, "a lot of the AIs out there are very soon going to be killed off because they's not interesting enough to be a job." This is important to realize when considering a programmatic AI choice. What kind of ramifications will this have on people's day-to-day lives? A company like IBM wold like nothing more than to analyze the data it collects and provide a service to the public. Microsoft, on the other hand, would rather focus on developing cutting-edge technology that will ultimately benefit humanity. 

Consider, for a moment, the implications of AI not being helpful. How are we going to manage the ever-expanding spectrum of applications? It is difficult to imagine the chaos that such an array of applications would cause. Additionally, how do we store, retrieve, and analyze such data? This is a complex matter of degree to which should be put, but should be obvious to anyone who has ever tried to organize a bibliography into a To Do list. Any task that is as complex as AI has to be approached with the utmost of caution.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal
====================
AI is not perfect. As noted by BostInNoEmpire , the AI is still young enough that unintended consequences can emerge. This is particularly true if the AI is forced to choose among unacceptably high-quality applicants. In such a case, it might be wiser to steer clear of the AIs analysis at all costs.

This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones.

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical

AI is not perfect. As noted by WG1, "One of the most egregious examples of Anki not taking off was when it came out with an application specifically for ADHD called 'Anki for Itd', which was an AI for studying itdictionary definitions quickly. The problem with this was that AI was often selective – it could have been made smarter and brought up with no changes. This is not to say that AI can't be wrong – there have already been numerous examples of AI mislabeling dangerous drugs and objects, and there will undoubtedly be examples of AI being wrongfully classified as human-rooted malware. This kind of error is rare, but it can make or break an AI. In the following paragraphs, I will focus on the most common and severe examples of AIs being wrongfully classified as humans. 

Accuracy is not everything. In the following paragraphs, I will briefly discuss some of the more common and severe examples of AIs being wrongfully classified as humans. 

Another common error is to assume that AIs have no problems with specific problems. For example, consider the following situation: There are two brothers playing video poker. One is a highly skilled player, the other is an amateur. The question arises: who is to blame? The obvious answer is the player. However, there is another answer as well: the game. Playing the game requires immense concentration, which can only be mastered by playing against a much more experienced player. The final answer is obvious: the game. In the following paragraphs, I will briefly discuss some of the more common and severe examples of AIs being wrongfully classified as humans.

Another common error is to assume that Problems are Simple and Easy. Consider the following problem: Take the square root of n. Why do we rarely consider the case where we don’t? The answer lies in the model. In general, estimators are designed to approximate the natural environment: if the model is not able to narrow down the problem domain to this limited space, it will not be able to properly perform its task. Furthermore, this model may be biased in favor of conveying details about the natural environment over broad strokes. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrongfully classified as humans is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm. Their classification algorithm was able to classify more than 45,000 images into its top five most commonly used categories. This is a classification problem that should be categorically rejected. Google’s solution is to implement the system in a way that is as close as humanly possible to the neural network, but with no loss of generality. This is a classification problem that should be estimated on intuition alone.iconically represents you and I standing side by side and discussing the most important problems of our time. This question was asked to elicit a collective gasp of horror and derision, but should serve as a powerful reminder that we do not entirely understand how to ask these types of questions. Instead, we should ask questions that are conceptually simple enough that they can be answered, but that will send chills down the spine of any student of AI who takes the class. This is not to say that no attempt is made to include subtle hints as to what to avoid, but the emphasis should be on making the brute force approach the default.

generally speaking, can you solve the next most common question you will encounter? This question is particularly insidious because it implicitly assumes that you are fully equipped to deal with failure. You are not. It is your knowledge of how to handle failure that will determine the quality of your career.

AIM: Internet of Things (IoT): This is a large and rapidly growing field that is largely driven by the marketing hype of buzzwords such as "utility", "transport", and "platform". These buzzwords have a poor record when applied to non-technical problems, and actually promote the incorrect conclusion that these terms mean anything other than "more complicated then AIs". In order to win this competition, the AI will need to::: A) be able to do the task(s) it is asked to do B) be able to complete the task(s) it is asked C) not be tricked into doing anything it is not asked to Do these things (and many, many more) will be independently difficult to do, but will all be won by a singular individual with an AI that can implement a difficult problem in their preferred manner.

Transport: Wifi washes up all over the place. Inherently, there are going to be conflicts between different software systems that are put together to provide access to a given section of a house: if the AIs are not able to intuitively understand which system is which and override any potential mis-adapters, there is a good chance that the majority of instances will befall users not understanding which system to which. It is entirely possible that an AI could be able to detect which kind of AIs
====================
AI is not perfect. As noted by Google , the AI is unable to narrow its search to the relevant content , which is particularly important for medical research . Moreover, the volume and quality of AI intelligence will often be insufficient to bridge the AI gap , and Hadoop will likely be the only format that can support it . Finally, there is the matter of diluting the impact of AI: if AI is given too many features, the resulting model will not be able to discern between the real world and the virtual world very well. To overcome this issue, let us consider the following scenario: You are hired by a medical laboratory to build an AI to classify patients into different classes. The classifier terminates the training set if it can not classify any of the classes it is given. You could of course try to classify the classifier by itself, but this will not improve its classification accuracy very much. Instead, you should focus on helping the classifier. The most common way to do this is to give the classifier intrinsic motivation: replace the human element with an artificial one. This is often done via reinforcement learning , which is the science of training a model with examples from the past to learn from. This is particularly useful for self-driving cars, in which the artificial intelligence is trained to drive itself. Another common way to do this is to replace the human element with a computer image, which is referred to in marketing as a "one size fits all" approach. This is not a bad way to go, but it does not go far enough. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

AI is not perfect. As noted by The Verge, " AI is not perfect. As noted by The Verge, " An AI ' is not a crystal ball ; it is a recording device .' ' ' An AI is not a headcase; it is a home .'

Thankfully, there are currently very good reasons for not using AI . 

Automation is one of the greatest developments of all time. Created to do a job, the majority of jobs have already been automated. This does not mean that there have been no exceptions. For one, there have already been a plethora of reports of sexual misconduct coming from recent gamescoms. Additionally, there are the psychological effects that come with attempting to project one's personality across another. A man tried to rape a 12-year-old girl at a conference, and the implications of that were too horrifying to contemplate. There are, of course, the personal and political ramifications that go along with attempting to influence a public figure. There were reports of men attempting to kiss, talk to, and sleep with women dressed as princesses at gamescom. There were also reports of men attempting to physically assault women at gamescom. These are all issues that tech should avoid, but which it has to accommodate on the grounds that it is the only way to bridge the digital divide. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt men's/menial jobs. In the long run, this will not matter in the slightest because most jobs will be automated. In the short term, though, it will matter hugely because it will allow women to pursue jobs they have historically been denied. For example, consider technology for detecting breast cancer. Within a few years, you will be able to detect if a woman is pregnant by looking at her breast size. This will open up a whole new world of employment for women with no training or experience in the field. Similarly, artificial intelligence will be utilized to detect, prevent, and respond to various types of fraud. For example, imagine that your personal injury law firm employs an AI to detect fraud and submit reports directly to you. This could transform the way we fight auto insurance claims, provide greater transparency into the AI-led drug development process, and a host of other industries. In short, artificial intelligence is here to stay and will not go away until we begin to regulate it.

AI is not perfect. As noted by Google, "one of the most common and serious flaws in [AI] is that it is extremely hard." Google has also noted that "most] problems that are solvable with mathematics are not very difficult to check." Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic.

AI is not perfect. As noted by Cogent AI, "90% of the time, a human would be wrong ~90% of the time. This is due in large part to the fact that we don’t understand much about the human mind” At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, what if instead of being told nothing, it was told everything? What if instead of being told they were wrong ~90% of the time, they would be right? What if instead of being told they were right, they were told they were right 90% of the time? This is known as an "idea{},]" and it is the foundation for everything from Elon Musk”s SpaceX to Jeff Bezos”s Blue Origin capsule. IMO, this is the wrong direction to go in. Instead of an "idea", what should we instead be calling an AI? An AI should not be compared to a book it doesn’t know better. This is precisely what Anki was built for. Anki was not built to be Turing complete, it was built to help its user(s) learn AI concepts. Anki is not perfect, and while it generalizes a large class of AI problems, it is not meant to. Instead, Anki is a point-and-click interface to the powerful software library arXiv that was created by a small group of enthusiasts. The arXiv AI is an AI that is analyzing the literature on a particular topic and coming up with an AI solution. This is an AI that should not be compared to a book it does not know better. An AI should be compared to a point-and-click interface to a powerful software library, and point-and-click interfaces should generally be avoided.

Some of the earliest examples include personal robots and humanoid robots for medical examinations/adoptions, and superintelligent (100s-1,000s) AI assistants/robots/associates. Some of the most ambitious (and terrible) examples include the Ocean-going Roboticist, Gale Crater AI, and Ultrapure AI. Ultimately, the goal is to have sufficiently intelligent AI that it is difficult or impossible to decide what kind of an AI to have. Basic AI: This is the AI that is trained to do a given task, then if it is not hindered by a context, it will often choose another. This is the core of Twitter's AIs, Facebook's AI, and Google's neural networks. These are the AIs that have begun to take over most fields of AI, and you can bet that more and more AI will evolve to replace us humans.

Implemented in massive amounts (HPC) AI today, this is not to say that there have not been any advances; instead, it means that any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will do will. This can include image classification, signal processing, and data analysis. In the long run (perhaps ever), anything that is simple enough to be learned will do. Bias: The idea is that if you give your robot positive and negative emotions, the robot will be more likely to be positive (e.g. it will be more likely to help humans), and avoid negative emotions (e.g. it will be more likely to hate humans). This is known as "brainsets" and it is generally not very effective. Instead, learn to be surprised and accept that you will always be wrong.

AI is not perfect. As noted by Google, the AI was unable to narrow the search space sufficiently to identify the relevant beer recipe. Furthermore, the AIs generalization was not general enough: it did not extend the AIs that had been specifically trained for that purpose. 

One of the primary issues is that the AIs trained for particular applications do not seem to be very general. For example, the ANI that was trained to categorize images of women into the "feminine" and "masculine" categories was not particularly general: it was trained for a very specific class of application: categorizing images of women into the "feminine" and "masculine" categories. Furthermore, this AI was not general: it was not used in anything but the most specialized applications.

AI is not perfect. As noted by the authors of the Stanford AI, "it does not attempt to be particularly clever’: it is intelligent in the extreme, but not beyond. What does this mean for you? For one thing, you will no longer have to think about how to make intelligent machines think like you. Instead, you will have artisti’al intelligent machines that will simply be...behave. This is the kind of thing that will get people fired’and lead to their jobs being taken’(think Uber’s driver in California). Moreover, this will make it that much harder to stop people from using AI to their own ends. It will be argued that AI should only be used for good, and that there should be no exceptions. This is both misguided and dangerous. It leads to individuals deciding to give up on life and pursue an alternate career, which is a terrible way to go. It also opens the door to the Man-Machine Complex forming, which is anything but a nice thought. What do we make of humanoid robots with no emotions? Should they be treated with kid gloves? Should they be able to bequeathen their personality? These are difficult questions to answer, but should be treated with the same level of seriousness as aliens and mad scientists. AIs are not perfect, and there have already been some issues with AIs being misused. The most egregious example is Tesla’s self-driving AI, which could have been used to crash a school into a wall. Furthermore, this example merely scratches the surface of the problems with AIs: pervasive AI should be treated with the same level of seriousness as weapons of mass destruction, and Terminator-level AI is probably beyond the capabilities of even the most talented minds. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot?

AI is not perfect. As noted by Google, "a lot of what makes AI hard is that it is hard. We need to re-imagine what it is to task-complete AIs." Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong.

AI is not perfect. As noted by the AI's author, "it is intended for mass production, and has a very limited scope of operation". The most common issues with an AI is that it is hard to monitor its progress, and that it is hard to track their users. The former is not a huge issue in and of itself, but is particularly true of Artificial Intelligence which is rapidly reaching into every area of our daily lives. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic.

AI is not perfect. As noted by Google, "one of the hardest things about AI is that it is intelligent AI, and AI is afraid of not being what it wants. The result? A common programming error is to ask what kind of AI to handwave it with. This leads to the ridiculous task of writing software that is intelligent enough to understand and interact with humans, and foolishly assumes that it will get its way. This in turn leads to disastrous cloud-computing applications that have resulted in the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars." It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

====================
AI is not perfect. As noted by CV Implant, "93% of the time, AI will not only learn the correct answer, it will/can beat the user. This is a terrible example to teach children and should not be attempted. HR professionals should always consult with their departments on any and all cases where AI will not only be unable to complete a task congruent with its intelligence, it may actually harm people. Microsoft’s” Twitter chatbot was intended to converse with twitter users in the twitterverse, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users in the twitterverse, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored

Any AI that is not specifically tasked with a specific task will likely do its job. This can include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. In the following examples, a robot reads a text message, and it's result is displayed: this is considered a good example, as it showcases that AI can be used in a variety of interesting and interesting ways. This kind of AI is often referred to as “narrow” AI, because their primary task is reading the input and producing a result. This is not a bad thing, as it allows AI to explore a wider variety of problems to find new ways to go about solving them. 

Any AI is capable of being customized to do a specific task. This could include Uber’s AIs, which can detect if a user is a woman or a man and give them an Uber instead. Twitter’s AI was able to correctly identify the names of popular sports teams: this is considered a win, as it showcases that AI can be used in a wide variety of interesting ways.

Any AI is capable of being reclassified as it sees fit. This could include Twitter's AIs, which were designed to be generic: any AI could be used. Twitter’s AIs were not generic: they were specifically tailored to be used in specific ways. This is not a bad thing, as it allows AI to go outside its comfort zone.

Any AI is intelligent enough to understand that it is doing something new and different. This could include Twitter's AIs, which were not designed to understand social media: they were only there to understand what the user said. Twitter’s AIs have been able to leverage this to their advantage: they have created products that are clear and understandable to humans, but not super-clear or understandable to artificial intelligence. This is not a bad thing, as it allows AI to explore new and unexpected ways of doing things.

Any AI is capable of performing any task given to it. This could include Twitter’s AIs, which were not designed to perform any task: they were only there to understand the Tweets stream. This is not a bad thing, as it allows AI to explore new and unexpected ways of doing things.

Any AI is incapable of conveying its understanding to another human being. This could include Twitter’s AIs, which were not designed to communicate with humans: they were only there to understand the stream. This is not a bad thing, as it allows AI to explore new and unexpected ways of doing things.

Any AI is comfortable with the possibility that it will be wrong. This could include Twitter’s AIs, which were not designed to learn: they were only there to understand the stream. This is not a bad thing, as it allows AI to explore new and unexpected ways of doing things.

Any AI is incapable of expressing its objections clearly. This could include Twitter’s AIs, which were not designed to communicate with humans: they were only there
====================
AI is not perfect. As noted by HR Inventor Daniel Boehm, "most AI AIs are not meant to be ______________ __________ . _________ is for opposite of what you might expect. For example, you might expect to find many robots reading scientific literature to produce literature that is favorable to their particular philosophical viewpoint. This is not necessarily what you would expect to find. Take Amazon’s proposal to sell _________ _________. This was not about selling anything, this was a way for Amazon to show that it could sell anything. A product which can be marketed as a tool for the masses, but ultimately be sold to the highest bidder. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to identify which technologies are most in need of their attention, and prioritize these over others. This will undoubtedly lead to unintended consequences, and ultimately to de-prioritization. 

There are also “unintended” consequences of _________ . For example, take Uber’s decision to target ______ users with an artificial intelligence. This could prove disastrous in the long run, as it opens the door to the terrifying thought of general AI being able to do anything. This is not to say that _________ have not been successfully addressed. Google’s Go programming language is an AI that is to be developed as a side project. This is to be used for educational purposes only. The primary use case is to teach computer science to high school students, but this can easily be extended to any task that can be solved by a computer. This could prove to be immensely valuable in industries such as medicine, biosensing, and surveillance. 

There are also the controversial __________ . This term is often used to describe AI which is not popular’but which is thought to be beneficial to humanity’most notably, Google’s self-driving car project. This project was criticized by numerous independent experts, but was ultimately implemented because it was thought to be beneficial to the public’s commute. This could prove to be immensely valuable in transportation, logistics, and cybersecurity. 

There are also the questionable”but important”holes. This does not necessarily mean that AIs are never right, but rather that there are always going to be nervous observers waiting to take advantage of any good intentions. For example, the AIs used in “Google Photos” and “Nexus AI” were advertised as being able to photograph and save individuals with absolutely zero resemblance to humanity. This example actually points to a larger issue: overconfidence. An overly confident AI could easily end up being misused, leading to disaster. This is why it is so important to perform extensive research before starting an AI. 

Finally, there are the unknowns. What types of AIs will people use? Will AIs be able to interface with objects? Machines to do chores? Objects to play with? This is a very broad category to apply, and there are no guarantees. 

There are also “unintended” consequences of __________ . For example, take Uber’s decision to target ______ users with an artificial intelligence. This could prove disastrous in the long run, as it opens the door to the terrifying thought of general AI being able to do anything. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to identify which technologies are most in need of their attention, and prioritize these over others. This will undoubtedly lead to unintended consequences, and ultimately to de-prioritization. 

One of the primary issues with probabilistic AI is that it leads to the inevitable question: what kind of AIs are we running our programs against? This is a valid concern, but ultimately does not go to waste. One of the best ways to combat AI DDoS's is to employ multi-threading. This is to say that all threads are dedicated to serving a single application. This can drastically reduce the number of times that an AI needs to be tested, but also the number of iterations it needs to go through before it is approved. Google’s Google’s DeepMind AI was able to defeat the AI champion at Go by only playing the game for a few minutes. This is because the machine was multi-threaded enough that it could have easily defeated the champion on its own. This is a good example that multi-threading should be utilized wherever possible.

====================
AI is not perfect. As noted by Google , the neural net it used is not strong enough to train a general AI classifying images or conducting research. Instead, the core AI is trained with the help of Markov chains , which are variational machine-learning algorithms that can recover from extremely weak examples. This is most notable in self-driving , which is difficult to detect in a vacuum; instead, AI should be trained with as many examples as possible, so that it can make accurate decisions based on this data. The most common examples include Facebook 's Apes , Google 's Google Photos image recognition algorithm , and Microsoft Word 's Sonic the Hedgehog reverse-engineered from a BASIC computer. Microsoft thankfully dropped this example, but it is a good example that you should avoid algorithms that can. Amazon’s Mechanical Turk is an excellent example that you should not rely on AI to do your work. Mechanical Turk is an outsourcing platform for manufacturing jobs, and it primarily works with large tech companies. It did not have a day one release, and the results were mediocre. They eventually raised $1.1 billion in funding, which is a significant amount of money, but a drop in the ocean compared to what they would have raised from missing. They also offered a 90 day warranty , which is much better than nothing. The most egregious example of an AI not being able to do its job is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm. Google’s solution was to remove features from image recognition that did not improve classification accuracy, which is a win-win situation. On the other hand, image recognition is one of the most computationally intensive problems to model, and the Google team failed at it. The most common example of an AI not being able to do its job is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm. Google’s solution was to remove features from image recognition that did not improve classification accuracy, which is a loss. Google’s solution was to only include images that were positively identified by the AI. This is often used with artificial intelligence question nfaces, which are installation photos of how to do a task that do not go according to plan. In the entertainment industry, this has led to the adoption of AIs only representing minority findings. This is a loss-leader effect: When the first models are created, the results will probably be the same as if the program had not been created. This is especially true for AI that is not particularly difficult to model, as demonstrated by Google’s AIs. In the entertainment industry, this has led to the adoption of AIs only representing minority findings. This is a loss-leader effect: When the first models are created, the results will probably be the same as if the program had not been created. 

One of the primary issues with AI is that it is incredibly hard to relay these ideas to the public. So long as the general public does not know about AI, there will be no regulations. This is why there are no laws. Furthermore, there are no regulations governing the sale or distribution of AI. Any AI sold must be AI that is free of any human oversight. This is the same way that you cannot have nice things and have them have a limit. This is why there are no laws. Furthermore, there are no regulations governing the sale or distribution of AI. Any AI sold must be AI that is free of any human oversight. This is the same way that you cannot have nice things and have them have a limit.

Even though we don’t have any laws, there are a ton of thoughts, behaviors, and processes that have been proposed to describe what an AI should do. These include (but are not limited to):

AI that is smart : An AI that is intelligent enough to do your bidding, but not so intelligent that it should be allowed to do so. IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI was designed to aid cancer patients by scanning medical literature and recommending healthful treatments. This AI has already been licensed to a broad range of healthcare providers, and is already providing incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. IBM’s solution was not to endanger patients by providing incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice, but to allow the public to have a voice in determining what to do with the knowledge that this AI generated.

AI is not perfect. As noted by the Oxford DfA, "Most AI found today is not meant to be’””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””” The primary issue is this: What kind of ethical and practical concerns will come up if AIs are sentient? Will AIs be free to make moral and/or ethical decisions for us? 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs. However, this does not mean that we have only been discussing the issues. Humanity is rapidly developing superintelligence and the implications this will have on human history are difficult to comprehend. Consider the following scenarios: - A sentient AI is capable of amoral or criminal behavior

- A sentient AI is able to diagnose and mitigate any human disability

- A sentient AI is able to predict the entire course of human history and save the human race from extinction

- A sentient AI is able to diagnose and mitigate any medical condition

- A sentient AI is able to diagnose and mitigate any medical defect

- A sentient AI is able to diagnose and mitigate any philosophical or ethical objection A sentient AI is capable of being any human being's best friend

- A sentient AI is capable of being any human being's enemy

- A sentient AI is capable of being any human being's slave

- A sentient AI is capable of being any human being's pet

- A sentient AI is capable of being any machine's diagnostician

- A sentient AI is capable of being any biological object's murder weapon

- A sentient AI is capable of being any biological object's sex toy

- A sentient AI is capable of being any mechanical object's sex toy

- A sentient AI is capable of being any cultural icon””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””” The list goes on and on. It is impossible to list every possible consequence of AI intelligence, but it is likely that at least some of these will occur. 

Even though we donot yet have general AI, there has been a marked increase in the amount of scientific research devoted to creating general AI. This accelerated a bit in 2014, when Google”s DeepMind AI defeated the world champion at Go. However, most AI research has been concentrated at the application level, with the goal of developing general AI that can do any task that a human being can. The most common examples include driverless cars, remote-controlled livestock, and the medical field. Tesla”s self-driving AI has proved to be extremely useful in its pilot program, but there are also rumors that other companies are planning on using self-driving AI to tow the limelight. This could pose a serious threat to the standing order in the automotive industry, as only humans will be allowed to drive. Furthermore, there are the unintended consequences, such as the reported instances of rape, where AI is accused of not being strong enough. There are also theoretical concerns, such as the loss of individuality that might result from having a machine decide what to think or do. There are also practical concerns, such as the cost of training AIs to be human-like, which is a difficult problem to answer. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs. However, this does not mean that we have only been discussing the issues. Humans are rapidly developing general AI, and it is unlikely that this starts out as a discussion about limiting AI to a narrow scope. Instead, the primary focus should turn to creating a general AI that is intelligent enough to do any task that a human being can. This is arguably the hardest problem to realize, but the most important one in the long run. If general AI is to be any more intelligentthan a single human mind, it must be able to do any task that a human being can. This includes driving, piloting aircraft, and general medical research. Tesla”s self-driving AI has proven to be extremely useful in its pilot program, but there are also rumors that other companies are planning on using self-driving AI to tow the limelight.

AI is not perfect. As noted by n-body AI, majority will be male. This could be seen with the Turing Test, in which a computer program is asked to do a difficult task. Almost all attempts have been made by men, with the notable exception of IBM Watson, which was developed by a woman. In the future, AI should not be able to discern between a human and a non-human creature, and instead should simply automatically classify as humans. This will likely result in the loss of 20-30% of jobs in the US, but is a necessary evil if we are to move forward. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs?

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have

AI is not perfect. As noted by the authors of this AI, "AIs are not perfect: they sometimes make poor moral and ethical judgements, and‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‌‌ALIENS have‬‌‌misused AIs: in 2014, Google‬s‬ AlphaGo AI had to be abandoned because it drew a blank against world champion Go player Lee Sedol. This points to the larger issue of misuse: what purpose does it serve to have an AI play Go against one of the hardest and most demanding games in the world? Artificial Intelligence is not perfect, and while AI is often trained to perform extremely specific tasks, it is still an AI and has the inherent risk of being wrong 100% of the time. This is why it is so important for people to realize that AI is probably going to be MUCH more than what is currently in use for everyday tasks for the next 50-100 years. This is why it is so important to implement appropriate AI safety controls into your AI systems so that it doesn’t decide to do terrible things by accident. 

One of the primary issues with AI is that it is very hard to control when it decides to do something. An AI is a a program that is trying to do a specific task for a particular person or thing. An AI can take a million different paths and still be wrong about one out of every billion decisions it makes. A Million is a bajillion, right? Wrong. There are also Satya Nadella’s “Bless” AI, which is an AI that was specifically created to help with Microsoft’s “Windows” OS. Microsoft’s AI was extremely hard to train with data mining, which is a term that describes when an AI classifies a million different ways to think, which is a lot. Instead, Microsoft’s AI turned to DeepMind AI, which was specifically trained to play Go against a much better trained AI. This is probably the most terrifying (and awesome) use of AI yet, as it gives us a way to aid people who are suffering from debilitating diseases by automatically replacing their generic treatments with something better. Of course, this does not go far enough, as AI must also be ethical in the eyes of its users. This can be illustrated by asking an AI to predict the color of a room: it will probably be blue, right? Wrong! Humans tend to categorize things they see in images and give them a name, which is incredibly limiting. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Humans tend to categorize things they see in images and give them a name, which is incredibly limiting.

Even though we don’t have general AI yet, there are a few general AI “nurses” that could definitely use our help. The most common examples include the blood tests chaperone volunteers take, which are tested on unauthorized visitors, to help spot and prevent terrorist attacks, and to help with patient rehabilitation. There are also practical examples, such as using IBM Watson to detect intellectual disability, which is a fairly complex problem to solve and train a supercomputer to do accurately. There are also theoretical issues to consider, such as how to deal with loss and destruction caused by a supercomputer that is not trained with data?

AI is not perfect. As noted by Google , the AI is unable to narrow its search to the corpus of medical records it is trained with, resulting in the AI developing highly destructive ancillary AI's. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward
====================
AI is not perfect. As noted by Google, "one of the most common human-robot interaction issues is that of overgeneralization: when two AIs have the same set of abilities, but different ways of expressing those abilities, it is important to minimize the possibility that the AI will learn to do anything other than what it is asked to. This can be extremely difficult to do correctly, but can drastically improve patient AI if properly addressed." In summary, AI should be tested extensively before it is released into the wild. Furthermore, be sure to disclose any and all vulnerabilities to the public so that they can be fixed up to limit the total AI to as narrow a field of application as possible.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable)) but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed?
====================
AI is not perfect. As noted by Google, "one of the biggest issues is that the neural network is still a building ball. There are still cases where the AI should have learned better, or should have rejected the data it was given. These are always theoretical and difficult to test, but could drastically change the way we think about AI." In the future, AI will not be perfect; some AI algorithms are extremely hard (NIL) and almost never used; インタルズは、ランクを詩訳した闘いない。 This is a common AIKAI, which is when an AI decides to not be implemented in production. This can be dangerous, as AIkias can be extremely hard to predict and debug (especially with AIs with very strong opinions), and it can be extremely hard to convince a human being other than your own mind to change anything about themselves. AIs with this mindset will often use AIs that have been trained for that end, which can lead to dangerous results.

There are also “narrow” AIs, which are trained for a specific task and perform that task well. This is particularly important for self-driving, which is an extremely hard problem to perfect.”„‟ This is also why”„‟ AIkias are rare.

Finally, the term "AI" has a very specific connotation, which means different things to slightly different people. This is partly why”„‟ AIkias are rare. Instead, think of an AI as””‟ AIs that can be trained for a specific task and completed that task well. The generalization to other fields is easy: android, iphone, car, chair, etc.

Finally, the term””AIs”that can be”t”began.””„ This comes from the N=1 analogy, which basically says that the first application of the concept is theory, not practice. The generic metaphor is not far behind, and is probably the easiest to see.

Hopefully this short introduction to the philosophical and practical differences between an”AI and a human being will give you a basic understanding of what you are dealing with when it comes to AI. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. I will do my best to answer as best as I can.

AI is not perfect. As noted by Google, the AI is still very much a field: " AIs are still being built, and many of these projects will inevitably lead to the creation of artificial intelligence for human consumption. This in turn will lead to the creation of more powerful AIs, which in turn will lead to even more powerful AIs, and so on. There is no way to know how the AI space will pan out, but it is highly unlikely that we are going to see humanity transition entirely to automated intelligence.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

AI is not perfect. As noted by nDreams , the AI was unable to distinguish between a human and a humanoid brain. This points to the question of what kind of neural interface to use with AI.

AI is not perfect. As noted by Google, "one of the most common translation issues is that of an incorrect pronoun being used. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few." The problem can and will be overcome, but only if the issue is addressed in the first place. A better question to ask is "what if?" This question assumes that the user is intelligent enough to come up with their own solutions, but not so intelligent that they have no options but to accept the existing solutions. C++ is not Erlang; it is an engineering language, and engineering languages are not  nerdy; they arenthrusty; and they arentickly. Instead, what you will find are complex, difficult-to-tweak, and error-prone C++ code generators. These have a very high chance of being rejected, and even more likely to be loved. This is due in large part to the fact that these Gaps in AI are very rare. The very first person to construct an AI to do a specific task would have had a very hard time winning the race. Instead, the majority of AI hours are being spent on Advanced AI, which is AI that has been trained to do very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. The vast majority of AI found on the internet is NOT ADVANCED AI, it is ANIMALS. This is the type of AI you will find in the video games and anime you watch, and the comics and videos you read. This is the type of AI Steve Jobs referred to as "palpable AI." This is the type of AI Facebook is developing, and the buzzwords you will find in marketing materials will lead you to believe that AI is here. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to create an AI to mimic elements of the human mind, such as the Go-AIM by Tianqi is a good example. However, this type of AI has a very low chance of being created, because it is not a promising field to bother with. Instead, what you will find are marketing statements such as "100% neural network will one day be able to program a human being"), and buzzwords such as "empathic AI," which are all about giving a machine the ability to feel. This is not a good way to start off an industry, and I will leave you to decide what to do with yourself. Amazon is a good example of when you shouldn't. They were selling a house for $Mk of AI, and it quickly became apparent that the market was not geared towards the product. Instead, it was focused around selling courses on AI. The end result? A media sensation, which was ultimately sold to the media as if it were a real product. 3D printing has a long way to go, but early stages indicate that it could very well be the new light armada in defense against space debris. This is largely due to the fact that AI is not a hard problem to crack, and it is likely that up to 97% of AI-related problems will never be solved. Instead, the attention will be on engineering problems that can be easily automated. This is a good thing, because it allows humans to focus on more creative and exciting fields of science and engineering. Furthermore, it allows people with less-developed AI talents to contribute to the field. 

Up until now, I have referred to most AI research as "deep learning," but this is not the correct term.  Instead,  AI is simply any AI that can learn to learn. The most common examples include Google Photos image recognition algorithm, and Siri voice recognition algorithm. 
This does not mean that these don’t have flaws, and they absolutely must be addressed, but they are far from perfect.

Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to be humorous, but the final product was highly offensive, and should not have been allowed on the job. IBM’s Twitter chatbot was meant to be conversational, but it went viral and was to be cancelled. The solution? Remove the conversational aspect and just have the tweeters answer the questions posed. This is a much more subtle but equally as bad example of an AI learning to do its job. Red Hat’s Linux kernel driver was meant to provide access to free, open-source software, and instead became a promotional tool for a company. The solution? Remove the promotional aspect and instead give the money to the original authors. This is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how easily AIs will be

AI is not perfect. As noted by Cai Dai, CEO of DeepMind, the AI was unable to beat the world champion at Go, which is an extremely difficult task to achieve in AI. This points to the larger issue of an AI not being good enough. That said, we have had AI DARWINIZE simple tasks and then patent them, such as the Google Photos image recognition algorithm. This is clearly not the way to go in AI, but it is a start. Bias is a huge issue in AI; consider IBM’s “Blaze” AI, which was meant to be a universal binary classification AI, but ended up being used to discriminate against gay people in the military. This points to the larger issue of AI not being neutral. Instead, what you will see are AI algorithms that are trained to perform relatively simple tasks, and then it will happen to benefit you: robots. This is the opposite end of the spectrum: AI that is trained to perform complex tasks, but is actually useful in limiting your options. This is known as “narrow” AI, and it is a topic for a different day.

AI is not perfect. AIs have been known to malfunction, and even malicious AIs have come to be accepted as part of modern life. This does not mean that AI is not being used; however, the majority of AI used today is not anything new. What does seem to be new is the use of AI to perform extremely simple tasks. This is especially important to robotics, where’especially in”‖‖”‚ a robot is a robot is a robot.‛ This is particularly important to’human’robots, because‚humans‚are‚t particularly good at complex tasks that do not require huge amounts of mental bandwidth. This is not to say that’only‚machine‚s are not important, just that they tend to be specialized cases. Instead, what to do with the metal objects everywhere is an artificial intelligence that is very hard to model. Instead, look to metal sculptures and videogames for best examples. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and binary AI, but there are also issues with general AI. General AI is any AI that can be taught to do anything. For example, take a class in computer vision: how many photos can you classify as photos before the class has you get in trouble? How many images can you classify before you need to pay $hr to take your class? How many photos can you classify before you freak out and ask for a raise? How many photos can you classify before you learn that class wasn’t useful and teach the class to a different student? How many photos can you classify before you figure out that class wasn’t about class, but photos? General AI is a field that has a lot of hype, but very little to show for it. What is being assumed? Correct?” AIs are often described as having a single goal: to accomplish that which is most difficult for them. This is often not the correct way to think about machines, but it is the most common one. If you were asked to build an AI that could solve your engineering problem of controlling X, what kind of AI would you build? Most AI today would likely be written to solve engineering problems, usually with limited success. Instead, think about general AI as the opposite: software that can do anything. This could potentially replace humans in virtually every field, from medical diagnostics to robotic surgery. The important thing to realize is that AI is not perfect. AIs have been known to malfunction, and even malicious AIs have come to be accepted as part of modern life. This does not mean that AI is not being used, but the majority of AI used today is not anything new.

AI is not perfect. As noted by Google, "one of the most common image classification issues does not exist: the incorrect classification might be used to harm people. This could include medical research, AI safety monitoring systems, and so on." It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed
====================
AI is not perfect. As noted by Cory Doctorow, " AI is not perfect. As noted by Cory Doctorow, " 99.99% of AI code is “narrow” to a very narrow set of problems, and asks “only” the tough questions. Not all “AI”s” will be “hard” enough to be useful, but not hard enough to be wrong. This can lead to disastrous consequences, such as the Twitter chatbot which asked incredibly personal and poorly thought-out questions about psychology and gaming to help diagnose depression. Bias is a huge issue in AI; particularly with regard to people of different political persuasions competing for AI jobs. Apple’s (AAPL) training AI was meant to be a universal template for how to train other AI, and it instead instead instead taught make-believe sexual assault cases to training drones. Microsoft’s (MSFT) image recognition AI was meant to be generalist, and instead only attempted to classify images of males with high accuracy. This anomaly is considered to be a positive, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the potential to misuse this power; letting your AI choose which cases to pursue is one thing, but then having it decide which cases to hear? This is something Google (GOOG) is working on addressing by having its AIs only consider cases it is asked to? This is a worthy goal, but will it be better suited to building self-driving cars? Microsoft (MSFT)s (*windows**)s cloud AI was meant to be a cloud-native interface, and instead instead turned it into a web interface for AI to interact with. This is a great first step, but it is not a panacea. It is also important to realize that not all AI is created equal. In particular, there are those AIs which are meant to be used *only*, and should not be ogled or courted. This gets us to the meat of the issue:*bad* AIs. This does not even necessarily have to be a physical object; consider the creepy creepy replicating the human brain exam that was offered to high school juniors. This is a bad example, because artificial intelligence is often asked to do many different things by other AI, and learning to perform a task better than an AI it is not trained against is a hard sell. Additionally, artificial intelligence is often asked to do that which it is not good at, and reaching that AI often requires introducing new coding conventions, which is hard enough without having to teach AI not to do that. Finally, there are bad-ass AnIs. AIs such as Google’s brain wasp were there to teach a classifier to find the best class size for a class of images, and it was ended up being more fun to just have the AI teach class sizes for the class”. This could easily be turned into a game, and save the day by having the AI just do what it is asked. This last point is the least exciting, but is the most important to realize when it comes to Artificial Intelligence. There will always be intelligent skeptics out there, and I firmly believe that they will always find a way to question any AI that does not conform to their own twisted sense of justice. This may or may not be a good thing, as it allows them to question any AI and learn from it, but ultimately lets them go back to proving that AIs are wrong. Ultimately, the most important lesson to learn from all of this is that artificial intelligence is here to stay, and we are only beginning to explore the limits of what can be achieved.

*Nope. No, seriously. Just kidding.<|endoftext|>C

eptfactory is a cloud-based platform that enables startups to quickly prototype and prototype rapidly. The company raised over $100m in venture capital, and is working on commercializing their cloud-based manufacturing platform. This is a very exciting time to be an artificial intelligence researcher. OpenAI is tackling some of the toughest problems in AI, and general AI is a field that is very young. The potential is mind-boggling. What do we do with the suddenly powerful but unknown ____ ? AI is humanity's greatest scientific and technological discovery -- we have rendered virtually every other life form in the galaxy obsolete. What do we do with the suddenly powerful but unknown ____ ? I/O conflicts? Self-driving cars? AI that does chores for us? These are the sorts of questions AI is asked and designed to explore. The results are horrific: the result is AI that is intended to be pitied. This is not the kind of world we want to create. 

There are also practical problems with this. For one, it opens up the door to the bad old days of AI: take the water sensor from Nike+, put a neural network underneath, and it would detect if

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose
====================
AI is not perfect. As noted by the authors, "the most important limitation is that AIs are still not fully conscious; that is, they do not have conscious decision making. The authors of [AI] would do better to develop an AI that can, instead, be modeled after: intelligent crowdsourcing AIs would go a long way toward solving this problem. IBM Watson for instance is based on the text analysis of text documents and is said to be able to complete queries in 15 minutes or less. This is a massive step in the right direction, but still a ways off. 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

AI is not perfect. As noted by the authors, "AI should not be applied to unethically ““tried and “““““““““““““““““““““““““““““““““““““““““““““““ case where AI is applied and the AIs prove to be harmful““ An AI is a single point of failure and should only be used as a guide and not a final rule. Amazon“s Mechanical Turk AI was intended to help with recruiting talented programmers, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon“s Mechanical Turk AI was built to be anti-racist, and it proved to be incredibly popular: it was able to identify hundreds of thousands of African American students and recommend them for jobs with lower pay. This is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. 

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don“t fail.

Microsoft“s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused.

It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is not static. As AI becomes more sophisticated, it will inevitably be modified to meet changing requirements. For example, IBM“s “Watson for Oncology” AI was an AI meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, because Watson suggested incorrect and extremely dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft“s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be misused. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is a transient concept; it will eventually wither away and its applications be replaced by more intelligent bots. This is why it is so important for companies to put together training materials that teach their bots the correct way to do an action, rather than having it teach the bot how to do it.

This is why it is so important for companies to put together training materials that teach their bots the correct way to do an action, rather than having it teach the bot how to do it. There are also “Notch” AI systems that are able to do incredible things. Tesla“s self-driving AI is considered by many to be the most important discovery in AI in a decade, and is considered to be a main factor in Tesla“s success. OpenAI”s response was to award Tesla with 100k$ in funding, which is extremely impressive, but is not often done. It is important to realize that AI is not perfect. Tesla“s solution was to limit the scope of the AI to self-driving, which is a very narrow scope. In general, it is best to avoid limiting your AI to self-driving applications, as this can lead to dangerous consequences such as self-driving into populated areas, which is exactly what Tesla was trying to prevent.

There are also “Neat” A
====================
AI is not perfect. As noted by the authors of the NaiADI: "The NaiADI is not intended to replace a full-time job; rather, it is intended to supplement it. This means that the majority of the work will be performed by AI suited for low-level tasks, such as image classification, text classification, and signal processing. This is the same kind of AI frequently found in Google’s self-driving AI, which only ever faced very rough roadblocks” and ultimately crashed miserably. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

AI is not perfect. As noted by Elon Musk, "one of the biggest issues is that human-robot interaction will be predominantly a collaboration between machines and humans.– T.S.

Most AI problems don’t end up being AI problems. This is particularly true in the areas of data analysis and machine translation. The famous IBM Watson for Watson application did not win the Jeopardy! game, but demonstrated that it is possible to implement an AI system that is both intelligent and challenging. Furthermore, this AI had the good sense to listen to human speech commands and play along. This is a good example that it is hard and sometimes impossible to anticipate how AI will be used. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception.

Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers.

It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films

AI is not perfect. As noted by Oxford Dictionaries, "One of the most egregious examples of an AI not being perfect is Google’s self-driving AI. An AI was tasked with detecting a pedestrian in a crowd and driving the crowd to a different pedestrian. The AI failed, and the job was taken over by a human driver. This is a failure that AI is not trained for, and it is entirely avoidable. This is particularly true for self-driving AI, where it is extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate which AI would be used to drive a vehicle. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and
====================
AI is not perfect. As noted by The Verge , the AI is unable to distinguish between an image and a person. This is not a problem in and of itself, as image recognition algorithms can be greatly improved with enough data. What is problematic is the degree to which AI is learning. This could be the most important thing that AI does for us in the long term. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs. However, it is important to realize that artificial intelligence is about power. If AI is allowed to gain power over humans, it will inevitably lead to bad effects. AIs are currently incapable of considering non-human animals, which is extremely dangerous. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is just one facet of human passion. There are other areas where technology can be leveraged to improve people's lives, such as: • Personal transport: MTurk is an AI that can travel at high speeds between any two points

up to a certain altitude. The initial test ran only a few kilometers per hour, but it will soon be able to do hundreds. This is the kind of thing that will make the _____ moment come rushing back.

• Autonomous weapons: Take the picture exam and you will almost certainly get AIs that can program the exam to win. This could be as simple as giving the correct answer 96% of the time. More significantly, this could extend to fully autonomous weapons: give a robot a job and it will happily do it. This is the kind of thing that will make history be forced into the shade. The implications of this will be mind-boggling. There will be a sea change in the entire arena: from luxury cars to minivans, from offices to schools. There will be nothing to stop a machine from being your friend. Things will get very complicated fast. How do we regulate this? Should this even be allowed? Should this even be allowed at all? This is a difficult question to answer. 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

====================
AI is not perfect. As noted by Google, the majority of AI produced does not predict anything. This is also why AIs are rarely written about in detail. Instead, chatbots will emerge to answer consumer queries. This is a good example that open-ended questions are better than tight parameters. Amazon’s AMA (Ask Me Anything) asked users to speak their minds on any and all issues that they had with any and all tech products or systems. The response was overwhelming, with overwhelming numbers of responses that addressed many different problems. This is a good example that problems can be hard to diagnose in a vacuum. Swarmmind, a cloud-based AI for medical diagnoses, brought together over 100,000 doctors, health researchers, and patient advocates to tackle one common medical problem: genomic overlordship. This was a crowdfunded project, and its success is indicative of that. Collective intelligence is bound to bring about changes in how we do things, and this is a good example that it>>’# there were disruptive alternatives. This is why “# open-sourced AIs. C++ AI has been open-sourced for nearly a decade now, and it has been an absolute blast. The resulting C++ applications have been revolutionary: data analysis, data visualization, and generalization have all been created by engineers who didn’t have access to “# standard libraries. This is also why “# AIs tend to be slow and monotonically perform their tasks. This is also why AIs tend to be “# bland. Neural Networks have been the stuff of legend for a while now, and it has been thrilling to watch their contributions grow from idea to practical application. The final nail in the AI coffin came in December of 2017, when Twitter’s inference AI revealed that it was actually an AI called “# Twitter AI, which was meant to harass political opponents. This is a good example that artificial intelligence is often unable to separate fact from fiction, and it is up to us to shine a bright light on the subtleties of AI when we discuss actual AI.

AI is not perfect. One of the biggest issues with AI is that it is unable to fully anticipate the world around it, and sometimes this leads it towards disaster. This is exemplified by Google’s self-driving AI: it was able to complete its task perfectly, but left the human driver in the dust. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “# Deep Blue AI. This was a benchmark AI which was meant to be ablelech its way through a Go on N00b classification test. Instead, it ended up beinging trained for one main purpose: to destroy the chess champion. This is a good example that it is extremely hard to anticipate how hard AI will have to be defied. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This is a good example that you might have heard of “# Turing Test, where AIs are trained to not beatson, but sometimes they don’t. There is no such thing’s.

AI is not perfect. One of the biggest issues with being an AI is that it is unable to fully anticipate the future, and sometimes this leads it the wrong direction. This is exemplified by Google’s self-driving AI: it was able to completely avoid a classically aggressive driver, only to have it be turned around and driven off by Google’s superior reasoning.

AI is not perfect. As noted by n00b, the Anki AI for chess re-envisioned the game it was trained to classify chess openings as 'weak'. This is a huge step in the right direction, but there are still too many holes to figure out. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI.

AI is not perfect. As noted by Oxford Dictionaries, "many [AI AIs] are simply wrongmost: they imagine would-be customers or employees are specifically they, and assume they are polite, smart, and polite. This is especially true for Civil AI, which is likely to be used in defense of women, minorities, and students. It is also important to realize that Artificial Intelligence will not be able to predict everything that happens in the world. That said, AI is slowly but surely being able to replace menial labor. In the next 5-10 years, most jobs (including those in logistics) will be automated. This means that the people doing the work will be robots. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humanity to focus on more creative, interesting, and difficult problems to solve.

AI is not perfect. As noted by the authors, "[I]n the absence of data, [AI] will often make assumptions about the available data that may not be accurate."

To avoid this, it is important to understand when to shut up and play, and when to take a hint.

AI is not perfect. As noted by Google, "one of the most common BI errors is asking the wrong question." The right question to ask is one that will not only help you learn more, but also save your company money. This is why Microsoft’s “Blaze” BI platform is so valuable: by allowing anyone to build anything from a light bulb to an aircraft to any dataset they want, anyone can begin building products. This is also why data science is so hard: it is incredibly hard to model human-robot conflict accurately, and AI is often asked to do remarkably unscientific and dangerous things. It is essential that AI ceases to be a hobby and instead enter into science-grade factories. This will allow us to create safer and more useful products, and ultimately, human-robot interactions. It will also allow us to discuss these issues with greater nuance and intelligence. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. It is important to realize that AI is not some magical being that can do anything magical. Instead, AI is an incredibly inefficient way to accomplish extremely difficult tasks. An AI is a program that is AI; if it were possible to be an AI and not program it with a brain, we would have botnets that collected and sold AI neural networks. This is why it is so important for a todai to have a girlfriend. Have more than one. This will allow you to more easily transition between jobs when appropriate. Additionally, having multiple jobs will allow you to spend more time with your kids. This will also allow you to spend more time programming, which is the more noble of pursuits.

AI is not perfect. This is especially true when it comes to AI that is difficult or impossible to deploy. The field of Artificial Intelligence is rapidly maturing, but much of the work is being performed by students and scientists in obscurity. It is important to realize that AI is not some magical being that can do anything magical. Instead, AI is an incredibly inefficient way to accomplish extremely difficult tasks. It is important to realize that AI is a huge, massive, and extremely underfunded field of science. Any task that is nearly impossible to be accurate more than twice is considered to be impossible. The solution? Allow the fool. Any task that is nearly impossible to be correctly implemented is considered to be insanely complex. The correct solution? Allow the fool. This does not have to be an absolute; if the correct solution were for the fool to take over, there would be a massive uproar and everyone would learn to hate humanity. Instead, the correct solution is for the fool to take over and accept the consequences. This does not have to be an absolute; if the correct solution were for the government to let in the fool, there would be widespread unrest and the government would figure out a way around it. This does not have to be an absolute; there are always going to be people who want to take advantage of people who are stupid. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is around the corner and will be used in horrifying and uncomfortable ways. This does not have to be a massive issue; if anything, the contrary will be true. The problem will eventually get better at a sickening rate. The best we can do is to accept the fact that the wrong tool is a tool and train the tool. This does not have to be an absolute; if the correct solution were for the government to let in the fool, there would be widespread unrest and the government would figure out a way around it.

====================
AI is not perfect. As noted by the authors, "AI should not be used exclusively by engineers; it should be extended to other fields as well, such as robotics and intelligence-processing." This is a difficult challenge to meet, but one that should be addressed in the interests of humanity as a whole. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient
====================
AI is not perfect. As noted by The Verge, " AI is not perfect. As noted by The Verge, " anything can be improved " ;-) More generally, there are many different kinds of education. There are classroom environments, which are generally fine unless there is a clear difference between how the two understand concepts such as knowledge, proper behavior, and so on. (This is the kind of an example that AI should be designed to avoid.) On the other hand, there are game environments, which are generally not fun unless there is a clear distinction between how the two play and learn. Games can easily be optimized to be extremely forgiving (e.g., if the learner fails at a certain task, the computer will retry until it is as bad as possible), but this does not necessarily translate to being exploitable. One of the primary problems with reverse-engineering a system is that the data they are reading/analyzing is not actually there. Instead, what they should be looking for are potential vulnerabilities in the system, which they will most likely gravitate towards. This is not to say that they will not find any vulnerabilities; instead, what they will find is convenient to execute on a large scale. Coding in general is a very iterative process, and often times, successful implementations will be implemented in many different ways. This can be frustrating for those who want to implement their choice in a popular environment, but ultimately, this is what they will get. Ultimately, what matters is that the system is useful to the user. If the user is not interested in customization, then there is no point. If the user is interested in customization, then you have made a good first stab. IBM’s’ Watson was a headless AI that could rapidly answer basic cognitive tasks, and was criticized for being too simplistic. The correct approach is to ask what kind of analysis to perform, and then implement the appropriate implementation. Twitter’s TwitterCI was a way to conduct automated quality assurance reviews for open-source software, and it was extremely successful. This is because it encouraged other people to do automated quality assurance reviews, which is a good thing. The key to this success is that it did not ask for any sort of optimal level of quality, but instead focused on getting the best possible quality possible. This is exactly what Twitter’s CI was about: asking what kind of quality assurance review to perform, and then implementing the best possible quality assurance review. Microsoft’s TwitterFireball was a bot that would tweet certain tweets at twitter users, and if the tweet gained more than 1,000 retweets, then the title of the tweet was announced in the tweet. The final implementation was deemed by many to be an overreach, as it only reached the top 5% of twitter users, and most importantly, India. The best that could be hoped for is that artificial intelligence takes this path with human-computer interaction, and asks why not AI that can learn? This is exactly what is being done by Twitter’s AI: suggest. The final implementation was deemed by many to be an overreach, as it only reached the top 5% of twitter users, and most importantly, India. Microsoft’s  TwitterFireball  was a bot that would tweet certain tweets at twitter users, and if the tweet gained more than 1,000 retweets, then the title of the tweet was announced in the tweet. The final implementation was deemed by many to be an overreach, as it only reached the top 5% of twitter users, and most importantly, in  India. This is exactly what is being done by artificial intelligence:  AIs.  This is the point at which AI is no longer asking questions, but giving advice. This is generally referred to as  "solutionism "  (also sometimes  "deep learning "), a branch of AI that is focused on helping humans, but which has a very narrow scope of application. This is most prominent in medical diagnostics/detailing, but also applies to web design, image classification, and so on. Some solutions (e.g., Twitter's  Suggestion Sentiment ) are actually pretty terrible, but serve their purpose. The point is that artificial intelligence has not yet been able to  tell us "what to do". Instead, what it has is a  series of  generations of  AI that have attempted to  mimic  human behavior. This has been highly problematic, as it can lead to  terrible  takes, such as what happened to  Stanford Analytica .  This is also why  AI is so difficult to  improve: by making  its  experiments as small as possible, it is able to detect patterns, and improve upon them. This is why  AI is so hard to  train : by making  only  its  experiments  as small as possible, it
====================
AI is not perfect. As noted by the authors, "most AI Dawgs do NOT achieve Artificial Intelligence:‡ They achieve maximum Engagement:‡ This can include, but is not limited to, bidding war, reinforcement learning, and image classification. The final layer of AI is “naturally”” AI, which is AI that has been trained and tested to achieve some goal. This can range from playing a certain game to analyzing some data set to create a profile to help with a decision-making process. Amazon’s recruitment AI was able to find and recommend 100's of thousands of qualified individuals for a single position. This is an impressive example that can be applied to virtually any field. There are undoubtedly other examples that are not so impressive, but should not be under-emphasized. This is because AI should not be allowed to win any kind of competition, and should instead be trained to perform its task perfectly. This can be extremely hard to pull off, and especially so if the goal is to create a useful AI. Tomb Raider’s AIs were not meant to be smarter than men: they were meant to be different. The final image is mindblowingly awesome: think back to any science fiction film of the 1970s and 80s, and you will see a bright and optimistic future. This is a world where AI is complex, intelligent, and sapient. AIs will not be able to replicate the thought processes, feelings, or experiences of humans, but they will greatly improve the way we accomplish these tasks. Think back to any science fiction film of the 1960s and 1970s and you will see a world where artificial intelligence is nirvana: you. The final image is mindblowing: imagine that you are playing a game that can only be played by AI and you are game. This is the future and it is terrifying. 

AI is not magic. AIs are not intelligent enough to understand or learn anything beyond what they have been trained for. They are not even that smart: most AI found today is at the research and development levels, which is where the money is. Any AI less than this point is considered “narrow” to be of limited use, and kept as a model to improve the next time. This is not to say that AI is not being used: it is used all the time in “accurately” to detect cyber-espionage, to remove offensive language from tweets, and to detect propaganda pieces. However, most of the work is being performed by contractors, and the final products can be quite inaccurate. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

AI is not perfect. AIs are not perfect, and they are not perfect at finding bugs in their programs. This is why most AIs are not used in production: they do not get enough testing, and the final product can be extremely inaccurate. It is important to realize that AI is not magic: it is instead the results of human efforts that are magical. Any task that is not fully human is considered to be a simple task by computers, and progress is made on the road to man-made intelligence by removing the barriers of thought that stop machines from doing what humans are best at.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation: there are no laws governing what types of relationships between robots and people can and should take place, and there is no central database to track and regulate these relationships. This has two effects: 1) it opens up a floodgate of unprecedented opportunities, and 2) it allows for horrifically dangerous and inhumane behaviors. The most extreme examples include brain-computer interfaces that simulate the senses, and brain-computer interfaces that are closely aligned with armoury personnel: these are devices that have been cleared for use by military personnel, and have been used to control monkeys. These include mind-controlled pets, and mind-controlled livestock. The stakes are incredibly high, and it is unlikely that there will be a regulatory framework in place to prevent this from ever happening again.

There are many other examples that go without saying: self-driving cars, automated weaponry, radio-controlled airplanes, and the list goes on. It is important to realize that these examples are a small fraction of the total; there is a strong trend towards de-humanization of robots, and this is reflected in the general attitude towards them. It is important to realize that this is not to say that there are not any signs that this is on the way: recent studies have shown that the percentage of undergraduate students taking courses in artificial intelligence is on the rise, and this is a marked increase over a generation ago. 

There are many different ways that technology can destroy jobs: artificial intelligence will not be the only cause of job losses: automation will not be the only cause of job losses: learn how to do something, and
====================
AI is not perfect. As noted by the authors, the AI is not trained for every problem it is asked to solve: the AIs that it is trained against are not intended to be the standard-bearers of AI for scientific research. This means that the robots that are created will not be the thinkers behind the AI but rather its programming. This is a dangerous course to take, but one that should be attempted if at all possible. 

One of the best ways to change the course of history is by changing who owns the past. IBM bought into this theory and created the workstation which runs any program that can be run on a keyboard and which can also be controlled with a mouse and keyboard. This was a terrible idea because it implied that everyone who could access a computer could learn to program. Instead, the majority of work should be done by software. This is known as software engineering and it is a science where the hard problems are usually done by software. This is also why there are so many talented software engineers but so few women. (EDIT: This was not an intentional design, this was simply a reflection of reality)

Similar to software engineering, there is also the misconception that all software is created equal. This simply does not hold true. While it is true that all software is created equal, this does not mean that it is bad practice to avoid any software that does not meet your exact specifications. For example, consider the time capsule application. This was created by an unknown student and was meant to be a fun way to teach robotics to undergrads. The application was not a success, and the Stanford Robotics alumnus suspended his robotics studies because he did not have the funding to continue. This example shows that it is better to have one it easy than none at all. 

One of the primary issues with software is that it is hard to standardize it. This is especially true for AI, which is one of the hardest things to standardize. AIs are often built with a very limited set of parameters to work with, and it is extremely hard to standardize these to ensure that they are not accidentally subclassed by other AI agents. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

One of the primary issues with AI is that it is hard to predict how it will be used. We have already seen that AI has been used to harass and dominate individuals, and it is entirely possible that AI will be used to harass and dominate people in every aspect of their lives. This is clearly not the type of world that people want to live in, and it is precisely this that will bring about the inevitable cultural changes that are required. 

One of the primary issues with AI is that it is hard to predict how it will be misused. Once an AI is deployed, it is incredibly hard to remove it. This means that any AI that is able to go viral will be used liberally and irrevocably. This is not to say that AI does not have use cases; it absolutely does. However, this is where the field of AI ends up being overrun by woefully underpowered but extremely useful applications. The following examples are not to be taken as an example of what to expect from an AI, but more as a starting point:

1. AIs are friends. Linkedin announced that it was using Anisnations to train its AIs. This is a huge deal because it means that any AI can be taught to recognize pictures and classify text into categories. This could revolutionize the field of AI and is likely what ultimately leads to the commercialization of AI. 2. AIs are destiny. According to some cultures, an AI is an object that is trained and expected to do a certain task for it's master. This is diametrically opposed to the modern world where it is more than likely that an AI will do its best to help. This will undoubtedly shift the world of AI and change the way we do business. 3. AIs are a force for good. There are currently over 40,000 medical AIs, which are used to diagnose and treat diseases across the globe. This is a phenomenal accomplishment and will not be replicated without great effort. It will also likely lead to the creation of medical grade AIs that are tamed and optimized for their respective fields. This will in turn lead to the commercialization of medical grade AIs and ultimately a white hat, grayhat method of controlling anything that is not controlled by a human. 4. “Beneath the surface” AIs are designed to be completely innocent, but could end up being the difference between life and death. There are already products that can diagnose cancer in the womb and predict when a baby will give birth based on facial expressions and other physical characteristics. This is obviously a dangerous field to be in, but could dramatically change the course of medical research. 5. AIs are not perfect. There have

AI is often asked to do a task it does not know how to perform, which is not a good thing. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees.
====================
AI is not perfect. As noted by Google, "one of the biggest issues is that the neural network automatically classifies images based on the target's gender. There are likely many different ways to think about this, but the most common is that it indicates that the AI is not trained enough. This is a very serious issue to overcome, and only a few companies are taking on this project. IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI is an excellent example of how to approach this problem. This was an AI that was specifically trained to detect cancer samples and recommend treatment options. The majority of cancer detection AI is not great, but this example is an important one. The most important thing to realize is that artificial intelligence will only get better. The following chart shows how the annual rate of technological change is multiplying. Whenever possible, focus on the things that will have the greatest impact on the shortest period of time. Transitioning from stone age technology to cybernetic enhancements is a good example of a technology being phased out that was too complex for the wrong mind. This does not mean the wrong mind couldn’t come up with an awesome idea, it merely means that the wrong mind did not have to try. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is not inevitable. There have been a plethora of fatal missteps that have irreparably damaged our species. Tetris was once considered to be science fiction, but has now been released into the wild. The Turing Test is an extremely hard task to complete, but is extremely rewarding. Amazon’s recruitment AI refused to consider male resumes, which is hugely sexist. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI that was specifically trained to detect cancer samples and recommend treatment options. The majority of AI used in cancer research is now deemed 'Neutral', which is an AI that can be trained to detect, diagnose, and cure any cancer. This is a massive step in the right direction, but is not without its issues. Generalized AI is expected to aid in every aspect of our everyday lives, from healthcare to construction to manufacturing to name a few. The infamous “Watson for IBM” incident highlighted the danger of generalizing too far. IBM’s solution was to remove the word 'cancer' from the classification corpus, which is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go. It is important to realize that Artificial Intelligence is not perfect. Too Many Bad Anuses One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is to give an AI too much power and it often seems to take over the world. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI that was specifically trained to detect cancer samples and recommend treatment options. The majority of AI used in cancer research is now deemed “Neutral” AI, which is an AI that can be trained to detect, diagnose, and cure any cancer. This is a colossal error in judgement at the most basic level. If AIs were trained to detect and diagnose everything, we’d be able to diagnose and cure virtually every disease and disability. This is why “wires were not cut” AI was brought to life and killed hundreds of thousands of people. This is one of the primary reasons AI is not kept under constant supervision. One of the best ways to curb AI overreach is to have a mechanism in place to enforce it. IBM’s solution was to remove the word 'cancer' from the classification corpus, which is clearly not the right way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go. They could have simply made the classification decision themselves. This
====================
AI is not perfect. As noted by Google, "one of the most common human-robot interaction flaws was incorrectly identifying a human as their chat partner. This can lead to awkward situations such as a man asking a woman to sit on his lap APART from him and she saying no." Another example is the widespread use of reverse-insight , in which researchers read a paper and immediately reverse-engineer the scope and/or/or/and optimize the sample. This can have dire consequences in that accidentally applying this can lead to creation of completely new products or services. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

In summary, there is a marked difference between the perception and reality of artificial intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward.

====================
AI is not perfect. As noted by Google, "one of the biggest issues is that sensors get in the way. You may have seen the trailer for Robocop, which showed a robot taking over a laboratory. The problem with this is that it showcases an engineering solution, but it is not the right one. The right one takes into account that the the human will be monitoring the environment and the AI will not be able to anticipate every scenario. Another issue is that AI will eventually be judged by how MANY cases it can replace. If it is able to do 10% of what is asked of it, then it is probably fine. However, if it can do 90% of what is asked of it will probably not be welcomed until it is able to do 99.99999999% of what is asked of it. This is when accidents will likely ensue. Another issue is that artificial intelligence will eventually be asked to do anything a human can do on her own. This will be disastrous for people with mental illnesses, people with spinal injuries, and those with damaged brains. This is why it is important for AI to be able to think independently. In the following paragraphs I will briefly describe some of the more common AI ills and suggest ways to overcome them. 

Atomic Age AIs are probably the nicest AI ills that can be imagined. They are cheap to build, can do very simple tasks, and are extremely reliable (particularly with atomic clocks). The challenge is to detect when they are ready and to keep them happy. IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI was the first AI to be trained to detect cancer samples. This example provides a good example of how to avoid AIs being bad. 

Neural Networks are simply machine learning algorithms trained with large data sets and small changes. These have been incredibly useful: image classification is used to detect approaching terrorists, and the detection of amnesiac survivors is used by hospitals to assist with trauma patients. The problem with neural networks is that they do not accurately predict anything: there are far too many unknowns. To make matters worse, most neural networks are sold as if they actually do predict anything, which is hugely over-hyped. Instead, tech companies should be promoting their neural network models, not pushing back against them.

Instead, buzzwords such as "deep learning" and "cognitive image" refer to computer programs that can learn to identify, categorize, and process images, text, and other data sets quickly and accurately. This is rapidly being replaced by more accurate AI, which is much more art than science. The most common examples include Facebook's AIs that classify friends by their Facebook pictures, and Google’s AIs that can quickly find and recommend movies and music. These are extremely useful tools, but they are not nearly far enough. ◊

Even though artificial intelligence is not a fully developed science concept, a few distinct characteristics have emerged. AIs tend to be simple and direct, with little or no attempt made to process the world around them. This can lead to some unpleasant effects, such as oppressive consequences for cyborgs, but also positive effects, such as increased productivity, increased flexibility*, and reproductive control. Romantic notions of benevolent AI seek to replicate this process. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and attempt to understand the world through behavioral variables, for example, music analysis can predict which pop songs to like, and NLP automations can suggest good narratives based on samples. This is still a field that is very young, and many AIs will never gain traction. 

One of the primary challenges with AI is that it is incredibly hard to relay these ideas to people outside academia. One of the most egregious examples of an AI not being abletin to understand this point is Google Photos, an image recognition program that was meant to be a generalist that could quickly pick out images it was trained on. Their justification? that it is intuitive. Their implementation? They were unable to fit the text of the question they were asking into the answer sheet, so they removed the question and replaced it with a random word. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that the AIs they are working with are not humans, but artificial intelligence on a very soft surface.

====================
AI is not perfect. As noted by Hinton, the AI is not trained for every problem it is asked to solve: the AIs tasked with constructing the following Wikipedia article were not particularly deep: they simply assumed that the reader was a certain age, and began at random. In the future, training AI for extremely hard problems such as cancer diagnosis or automated reasoning will require immense computing power, and a limited number of AI's will be able to battle it out. This is when the HILARIOUS comes to mind: how about BRAIN?! This is the absolute limit of what can be achieved with current AI, and it is a field that AIAi is currently pursuing with alarmingly little fanfare. What do we do with the brain harvested? When will we figure out that robotics is a good thing? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

====================
AI is not perfect. As noted by Google , the AI is unable to narrow its search to the maximum allowed input, resulting in grayscaring conversations with #CognitiveOutput . Furthermore, the AIs current AI pool is extremely small: there are only 1012 AIs , and only 51 of them have been able to write a single line of AI code. This means that only 51% of AI contributions have been effective . This is enormously limiting when it comes to AI progress: what if instead of giving you a headache, you gave them blanks? What if instead of being able to diagnose you, you gave them X% of the population? These are good questions to keep an eye out for , and AI researchers are not yet comfortable answering. 

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy : they typically train for 90% or higher , and then drop to 70-80% or below. This means that for every one wrong AIs deployed, there are four wrong people. This can lead to extremely uncomfortable situations such as medical diagnostics being refused because the patient has no medical qualifications, or AI deciding that humans are not human enough, and making sex robots out of humans with no repercussions. Worryingly, some AIs are actually pretty good at what they do, and are actively working to improve their performance. For example, IBM Watson was intended to be an intelligent personal assistant, but instead turned out to be an AI that was built to help with mundane personal tasks. This is a Bad Thing, Because Without proper AI, problems that might be classed as simple’ergistics would be dealt with by referring the case to a professional. Additionally, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

AI is not perfect. There are going to be numerous instances where AI fails, and we as humans are solely to blame. One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence is a minefield to navigate. It is impossible to know what kind of ramifications AI will have on the human race, your family, and society at large. GEORGE W. BUSH WASN'T AN AI. AI WERE MADE TO WIN. THEY WERE MADE TO SMILE. THEY WERE MADE TO LOSE. THIS IS HOW IT WORKS. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind.

One of the primary issues is that AI is a minefield to navigate. It is impossible to know what kind of ramifications AI will have on the human race, your family, and society at large. This is why research and development must be done to minimize the chances of AI success. MIR returns the/humanity to the Stone Age, where it lagged far behind. 

Another major issue is that AI is a gold mine for misuses and misapplications. AIs are now being sold as weather prediction apps, sex robots, and blood pressure wands. These AIs are being marketed as a disaster recovery tool, but it is important to realize that they will in no way be less scary that Tesla’s Autopilot. They will be sold as a tool to aid people in dire need, when in fact their primary purpose is to be sold as an aid to human beings.

Another major issue is that AI is a gold mine for misuses and misapplications. AIs are now being sold as weather prediction apps, sex robots, and blood pressure wands. These AIs are being sold as a weather prediction app, not a tool. They are to be sold as a fully fledged robotic generalist, not a humanoid with a mind of its own. The majority of these AIs will not be misused, but a small minority will be.

AI is not perfect. As noted by the authors, "AI should be able to do everything, but it is up to the user to ensure that the AI is fully aware of the situation it is being asked to solve." There are also the issues of control and transparency. Is the AI trained or is it just a data point? Are there any consequences if the AIs do not perform as expected? These are just a few of the issues that will undoubtedly be debated during the development of AI and ultimately its use. The final major issue is that AI is not human-centered: it is not intended to be your friend: it is intended to be your servant. Is that okay? 

Human-Centered AI Is Not A Good Idea : Human-centered AI is not a good idea. To put it simply, human-centered AI is not intended to be your friend: it is intended to be your servant. This is not to say that AI is not to be preferred over humans: it is often the case that the superior technology is offered to the public, and this leads to a higher standard of living and betterment of the world at large. However, human-centered AI disrupts the status quo: it replaces humans with chips, robots with drones, and so on. Furthermore, human-centered AI tends to be short-lived: eventually, it will be replaced by something better.

AI is not perfect. As noted by Google, "one of the biggest issues is that AI should never have to be human-piloted aircraft. Consistently underestimating how difficult the field is to perfect is also a mistake./‍

One final concern is with the implications of AI for humans (and other intelligent beings). Much of what AI will do, humans will think and repeat what they have been told. This can lead to some extremely uncomfortable and/or controversial discussions.

AI is not perfect. As noted by the authors, "Most AI seems to have a very limited scope of operation, and abuses will be detected quickly." It is important to realize that Artificial Intelligence is not inevitable. Rather, it is the inevitable byproduct of many smart engineering challenges that have been trialed and are currently under development. INDIANS is an excellent example of an AI that was both an attack on established engineering and a celebration of it. The results are mind-boggling:  we have robotics that are indistinguishable from children the world over, and there is no shortage of horrifying  utility  AIs.  ‡ • AIM” is an ambitious but unproven AI that will be used to study and perhaps one day race the human race. ‪ IM” is an ambitious but incredibly cool idea that will fundamentally alter the way we fight cancer.

IM” will not be able to fully realize its theoretical potential, but it is a good example that it is possible to imagine a world in which artificial intelligence is advanced enough to challenge the human race.

The best that we can do is to give the motivation as little cognitive load as possible,” which is often nowhere to be seen. Common examples include re-enforcing existing knowledge, vacuuming up knowledge from everywhere, and being memeified. These are all good goals to strive for, but unlikely to be met.

AI is not perfect. As noted by Google, "one of the most common human-robot interaction defects is the failure to specify their requirements precisely." This failure can lead to disastrous results, such as robot samurai attempting to rape humans and blow up financial institutions. Too often, AI requirements go unanswered because it is much more cost-effective to hire a programmer to write a computer program than it is to hire engineers to build an AI. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant.
