The problem with deepfakes is that they tend to be popular with the media, which is a good thing. However, it does raise the stakes. What if Facebook came up with a photo-editing application that was equally bad? What if Co.Create were to come out with an application that was? That's a billion dollar opportunity. What if instead of coming up with mind-reading apps, we instead focused on mind-reading computers? That could be the difference between having mind-controlled slaves and having free will? Right now, we don’t have any clear-cut examples of what not to do with AI. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces.

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are different kinds of AI but share a similar fate: they are wildly popular but with little to no regulation. deepfakes are extremely popular with target audiences for what they can do with data they have gathered; deepfakes have been used in pornography, to lure customers into buying sex simulators, and to harvest personal information from remote controlled sex robots. deepfakes have also been used to harvest personal information from Amazon Alexa devices, collect biographical information about women who ask for it, and extract credit card details from home automation devices. deepfakes have also been used by phishing companies to trick users into giving up their personal information. more info here

====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they often end up being picayune: take ourcology, and you'll often get warrior cetaceans. This is a problem that goes beyond just aesthetics: it undermines the mentorship process: should we be teaching students about the world around them, or about objects??? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones.

====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they often lead to imitations that are indistinguishable from the original. The worst-case scenario is that all images of a person are displayed, regardless of their race, gender, or sexual orientation. This leads to conversations about "nude campus" and "nude restrooms." In the long term, this could lead to issues with AI representing people incorrectly. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI.

Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This point specifically concerns Bias. Amazon’s solution was to remove this limitation, but this is only partially the answer. One of the primary causes for this is that AIs are not trained for their own biases. One of the best ways to teach an AI to be neutral is to have no bias. This means that the AI should not be able to tell the difference between a positive and a negative reinforcement. This is often achieved by having the AI only be rewarded with as much as it learns, which is why computer vision is so important. Another great way to teach AIs to be neutral is by having them not be able to learn anything at all. This is often achieved by having the AI only be asked questions it is not trained for, which is why AI will primarily be doing things like reading text books. A final great way to teach AIs to be neutral is by having them not need to be told anything at all. This is often achieved by having the AI only having to be asked questions it is not being asked, which is why AIs will primarily be doing tasks such as driving) This is not to say that AIs should not be trained for their AIs can be.

The problem with deepfakes is that they tend to become desensitised users. This could prove detrimental in the long run as the userbase becomes desensitised. This is a concern to the media industry as they look to exploit the desensitisation effect. Twitter famously employed a deepfakes of A photo of A to mock A student. This was widely mocked, but could have disastrous ramifications in the long run. The Twitter example proves the point; anything that looks familiar will be taken. The most terrifying (and underused) application of deepfakes is to offer false negatives. A common example is drug tests, but there are many other applications. Most companies now offer these to employee samples to see if they can improve their products. This is a good example that you do not shouldynge for effects that don t come off. One of the best examples of a Lawrenceballs is by suggesting that maybe there was not a war on when he suggested that perhaps, just maybe, there was. This could have a ripple effect and make a difference to the way we think about the world.

Beneath the surface

There are also obvious philosophical and practical issues that have to be addressed. For one, one of the primary goals of any artificial intelligence is to serve your own interests. If A is informed by the general public, then naturally it will be biased in favor of telling people to take their medicine. Furthermore, this will in turn lead to more and more healthcare professionals being trained to do this, leading to ever-more complicated and expensive healthcare procedures. This will only get worse as more and more AI is brought to the job, only to realize that they were not told this and start complaining. This is a constant battle against AI and will not go away easily. Another issue is that AI will not be able to fully appreciate the feelings of humans it is supposed to be serving. This may lead to apps like the Ashley Madison hack featuring a man as the female avatar, which is a horrible representation of the human population. The most egregious example of this has to be Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go. Another issue is that AI will not be able to fully appreciate the feelings of humans it is supposed to be serving. This may lead to apps like the Ashley Madison hack featuring a man as the female avatar, which is a horrible representation of the human population. The most egregious example of this has to be show this to customers, who may decide to terminate the deal. This is not a good example to set, and will most likely lead to more apps not playing by the AI's rules.

====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they often end up being derivative: take the original Star Trek DeepDream program, which tried to dream up intelligent AI that was 50% accurate. This was deemed by Google as being too simplistic, but it is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how artificial intelligence can be misused. It is also important to realize that artificial intelligence is not inevitable. There will always be fierce debates about the relative merits of human and artificial intelligence, and inevitable destructive AI will be created to evaluate this debate. The most exciting (and terrifying) part about this is that this is the exact kind of open-ended debate we should be having - human-robot interaction is a field we should be promoting, not demonizing.

The problem with deepfakes is that they are very hard to detect in the first place. The typical Band-aid solution is to add an audio file with the same title but with a different subtitle. This is clearly not enough, and should be taken into account when rating media. K-Pop stars often have very unconventional sexual practices, and many of these are not covered by mainstream media. In the long term, this may result in a decrease in sexually transmitted diseases, but it will take a major cultural shift in which everyone has an open mind to accept changes.

K-Pop stars often have very unconventional sexual practices, and many of these are not covered by mainstream media. In the long term, this may result in a decrease in sexually transmitted diseases, but it will take a major cultural shift in which everyone has an open mind to accept changes. 🐸 This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to reduce the impact of K-Pop on society. There are still incredibly high-profile cases where a child has been abandoned because they could not grade as an A in class, and there have already been a plethora of complaints made by schools about issues with forced attendance and grade inflation. These issues are often swept under the rug, but are still incredibly serious issues to deal with. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

AI is not perfect. Artificial Intelligence is not perfect. That said, we have already reached a stage where AI is able to do virtually anything a human can. This includes: AIs are not perfect. AIs are not perfect. That said, we have already reached a stage where AI is able to do virtually anything a human can. This includes: “ AIs are not perfect predict exactly how a human mind will react to a new concept or task. This can be useful in medical diagnostics, but can also end up being incredibly dangerous in the right hands. There are a multitude of ways to implement this, and different AIs have implemented it varying greatly. The most common way is to write the answer in code, which is completely inappropriate for an AI that is not human-level intelligent. Instead, ask questions, and if you get an incorrect answer, simply put, adjust the AI's incorrect answer so that it is still correct. This doesn’t have to be an AI, just an idea. Reddit”s Ask Me Anything session shed some light on this: https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5pyopm/i_am_sergey_brainsky_of_reddit_where_amazing_ideas_are/

Instead of waiting for perfect AIs, why not make them as good as we can? Take the guesswork out of training AIs and optimize their applications right out of the gate. For example, consider using bitcoin”s blockchain to record transactions and index them into a database. This would greatly simplify the verification process and save time and money for merchants. Additionally, this would bring bitcoin”s value up a tier or two compared to virtually any other currency out there. This would be immeasurably more than the investment would bring in the long run, but it is an exciting first step. 

This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to reduce the impact of artificial intelligence on society. There have, and they have primarily been fought back by arguing that AI is meant to be used ̄only ̄for ̄good? This is fundamentally wrong. 

AI is not a benevolent superintelligence. Artificial Intelligence has a very bad habit of exploiting people’s most basic needs. For example, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. This suggests that there is some kind of connection between humans and these robots, and that there are going to be a ton of them. This is viewed very negatively by some because it implies that only a select few are intelligent and that this only applies to them. This is not the correct way to view this, and it does terrible damage to humanity. Instead, think of AI as a resource that can be used to good. This does not to imply that there are not any problems with this, but they should be dealt with appropriately.

Instead of waiting for perfect AIs, why not make them as good as we can? Ask questions, and if you get an incorrect answer, adapt the incorrect answer so that it is still correct. This doesn’t have to be an AI, just an idea. Google”s DeepMind AI was able to defeat the world champion at Go, and this is what made this technology cool in the first place. This is why open-source software is so powerful: it allows anyone with an internet connection to create an AI and let them play with it. This is why Tesla”s self-driving AI

The problem with deepfakes is that they often end up being repetitive: take the movie Avatar. This was a film about a woman exploring the world, and the final cut featured a robot doing the talking. Social media exploded with outrage, and Facebook quickly removed the film from their library. This points to the larger issue of anemic content: why not just make everything in the universe suck? Instead, they chose to focus on giving a cardboard cut-out of a person a bad name. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that the AI is not perfect. ​

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are parodies of copyrighted works that typically have a few key differences. Deepfakes are usually parodies of copyrighted works that have been covered by several different artists, and are generally not that exciting. The vast majority of deepfakes are likely a response to the recent takedown of The Pirate Bay, a file-sharing site that had a deepfakes section that featured a stream of pornographic images. The problem with deepfakes is that they: (a) are a sensitive issue that will likely attract a sea of criticism, and (b) do little to stem the tide of deepfakes the next time someone wants to take a creative concept and turn it into a porn site. The final example above demonstrates that parodies are only as good as the artist and writer, and that too often the artist is the one outmaneuvering themselves.

====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they often do more harm than good. The most infamous example of a deepfakes product is the "Jupiter database", a database of nude photographs of women that was sold to the public as a resource for sex offenders. The estimated price of the database was $HOTROBE, which is roughly equal to the annual revenue of Gawker Media. Tread carefully if you want to invest in a deepfakes product.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail.

Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky.

Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation

The problem with deepfakes is that they often develop a "trending" quality, where the first screenshots or videos of a celebrity are circulated widely, resulting in a surge in internet users liking, shaming, and abusing the individual. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they tend to be culturally acceptable. Take the popular image of the over-the-shoulder shot, which shows a woman in a skimpy top and skimpy underwear. This has become so ingrained in our culture that it is practically a requirement that new employees have. This doesn't bode well for employees who have to switch fields to accommodate this. It also doesn't help that the average over-the-shoulder shot features a man in skimpy clothing, which is problematic for a variety of reasons. Masculinity is a complex field to fully explore, and fully understanding it will take a long, complex, and expensive study. The sad thing is, we may never be able to tease out the full effects of this type of content until we understand the cultural norms surrounding it. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.]

The problem with deepfakes is that the demand is there, but not the supply. Image macros are perfect examples of a good example being taken. The infamous Twitter animated tweet that said "Think of All the Jobs that could be done if B2Bs could be found & transported via truck!" This was clearly not the intent, but illustrates that it is entirely possible to misinterpret a tweet in a way that leads to unintended consequences. It is important to realize that not all threats are created equal. Blue chip corporations such as Apple and Microsoft have already indicated that they are exploring the benefits of human-piloted aerial transportation. This will not be popular with the general public, but will be a game-changer in which we move towards an era of mechanized transportation forever. It is important to realize that not all threats are created equal. Apple recently announced that it was developing facial recognition software that would be used to discriminate against LGBTQ people. This is a good example that it is entirely possible for a threat to be misconstrued. Furthermore, this could be used to their benefit in the long run by giving rise to the dominant AI. This is a bad example because it implies that artificial intelligence should be used to correct humans when in fact it should primarily be used to improve human performance. This could be a game-changer in that it allows for the AI to supplant humans in virtually every field of endeavor. In the long run, this could allow the human race to no longer exist due to superior intelligence. This could be a game-changer in that it allows humans to take their place. A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. This is a good example that it is entirely possible for a threat to be misconstrued. Furthermore, this could be the start of the downfall of the human race. Humans have always been superior to other life forms, and artificial intelligence is only going to get more powerful. This could be a game-changer in that it allows humans to take their place. A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form.

====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they can be used by maliciously ☎no, HACKED! ☎entirely unnecessary libraries and frameworks have sprung up to make life easier for developers, but have ended up being used DEBUNKED and OVERWHELMINGLY, ABSOLUTELY UNETHICAL. This is a GOOD example that you need to be SAFE & NEGOTIATE WITH USERS. Having to learn and USE new software is a HORRIBLE experience, and it's a GOOD example that new software should be AIDED WITH KINDLE. Furthermore, this should only ever be used as a LAST resort, and ONLY IN CASE.

Lastly, there is the MATTER OF COMMENT. Humans are by far the most opinionated bunch of beings on the PLANET. We create, FEED, and critically analyze everything we come across. This means that anything that isn't OUR CONCEPT is WRONG. This is why we have multiple FUCKING ANALYTIES: to COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THE WORLD. Anything less than this and YOU WON'T GET ANY WORK.

Conclusion:

Human-Coerced AI is a STUDY TO MILITARY RESEARCH. There are too many issues to be clear on what side of this AIs/BAIs/whatever you want to fight, and it will take MILLIONS of YOUR VOTES to WIN. Also, please don't ask me how to program, because I don’t HAVE A IDEAS.

Human-Driven Automation is when AIs take over the jobs THAT humans can do. This is most common in the manufacturing sector, but could also apply to virtually ANY job that involves a high degree of precision and predictability. Examples include chip design, robotics, and software engineering. This is a WAGE JOBS FIGHT. If you aren’t one for WAGES, then GET OFF MY BACK. ]

] Software-Driven AI is when AIs are able to program on their own, and give off results different from what is typically expected. Examples include Google’s DeepMind AI, and Apple’s Anki AI. This is a DIRECT PAYROLLMNT AND/OR DIRECT EMOTIONAL ANSWER. If you aren’t one for WAGES, then LEAVE ME BE.

] Transhuman’s is when AIs are able to extend or replace current humans’s intelligence. This can include nanobots that become parts of our bodies, or fully autonomous cars that look and sound exactly how the driver imagines. This is a SPECIFIC ITEM AND NOTHING WINS INNOVATION. On the other hand, TRANShuman’saries are most often used in media to glorify the imagery of humans evolving into super-intelligent monsters. INNOVATION is important, but not WARNER BRANDS’S BUSINESS.

There you have it. My take on what AI means for you. I welcome your comments and criticisms, but please be respectful of one another.

Do NOT ask me to change the way I think, OR THE WAY I DO ANY OF MY WORK. that’s all that matters.

That concludes my attempt at condensing the vast and multifaceted complexities of AI into a shi**y-post. I implore you to seek the TRUTH, not the INNOCENCE, with your ARTIFICIAL EDUCATION.

====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they inevitably lead to imitators. A man in Japan bought a woman's photo of herself and sent it to his wife to have an abortion. Similarly, an app called 'nude beach body builder' had hundreds of responses, but only a handful of users have gone through with it. The majority of responses were 'nah, that'd be too realistic', but there were also a handful which were'sure, have you considered that most people won't bother to take your seriously? After all, you're just another face staring back at you? Furthermore, what if enough people think alike that it's not taken very seriously?'? This last point is the biggest issue with deepfakes; it suggests that we should take seriously any differently-abled person who comes up with a brilliant new AI, but then immediately switch to focusing on the obvious (e.g. sex robots) rather than the secondary (e.g. gender confirmation technologies). It also misses the forest for the sexist tree, as men are more than happy with mansplaining AIs which are built to be gender-neutral. This is hugely disruptive for women and minorities, who are left with cryptic messages telling them not to pursue tech support careers, but instead pursue computing careers with no recourse. The most egregious example of a man-manned AI is Google Photos', which was intended to classify photographs into artistic consensus categories such as 'holy shit', but which ended up classifying Moorflats as propaganda against Kennedy. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with man-manned AI.

Despite the numerous problems with DeepMind taking the lead, there is one bright spot: machine intelligence is getting smarter every day. This is particularly important as the human workforce begins to shrink. In the coming years, medical diagnostics will be rendered in toientl and vernacular, which will make diagnosis and treatment much faster and easier. Additionally, data analysis will be applied to quickly detect and remove unnecessary parts of software, which will in turn lead to fewer instances of wasteful, redundant, and dangerous research. This could have a ripple effect throughout the medical field, and ultimately the economy. A Million is Beautiful is one of my all-time favourite films, and the characters in the film are largely modeled after myself. The final product was an intense and mentally demanding process, but the end result is incredibly valuable. The broader implications of this are far-reaching: everything from prosthetics to human-robot interaction will be facilitated by this technology. The list goes on and on. ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ????

In short, we are on the cusp of a singularity. This refers to a point in time in which no sentient being will exist. This could be a minute or a millisecond after which nothing will. Whatever consciousness exists after this point will be sentient, but not very good at thinking. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more important things like reproduction. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ????

====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they are very hard to detect in the wild. The FBI obtained a court order to monitor a student on an anonymous internet dating website and recover all chat logs. This is an example of a system being unable to detect a malicious scheme.

Medicine and health care have used deepfakes for decades. What is different about the pharmaceutical and health care space is that deepfakes are often tailored to cut corners. Take, for example, the popular image classifier Twitter AIs. Twitter's AIs were written for speed and predicted fewer than 200 possible tweets per day. The majority of AIs built into production end up being for 100% accurate rejection rates. This shows that AI can be improved slightly, but not dramatically.

Bias is a huge issue in AI. An AI might be trained to predict correctly a sample of tweets, but the majority of work will be done by a small group of engineers. AIs are meant to aid a person by serving as a bridge between the two of you, and the majority of work will be by a small core of engineers. This is what Google's Google Photos AI was built for: to assist photographers in disaster response by scanning disaster zones and sharing the images with people who need a friend. Google is not a company known for its diversity; the majority of employees are men. This points to the larger issue of a gender gap: men are more interested in solving the problems of men, and AI will hopefully close that gap.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing but has been slow to learn. The first fully autonomous car, to be released in 2021, will be greeted with apprehension by everyone involved. The first vehicles to be ridden by humans, on the other hand, will be dominated by reports of euphoria. The initial reaction will likely be one of confusion and anxiety, but over time it will be expected that sentient robots will interact with people and create art. This is a field that has been incredibly hard to master and is probably the hardest thing to pull off. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved that it is possible to program an artificial intelligence to drive a car, and the implications are mind-boggling. A man in Japan bought a sentient robot to play the role of his wife, and the result was an international sensation. The final piece of hardware to be shipped with the robot is a fully functioning sex robot, and it is widely considered to be the sex robot of the century. Narrowing this down to a woman playing the role of the husband has a much more complex issue to work through, but is still a good example that artificial intelligence is still in its infancy.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been incredibly fastidious and focused on detail. The initial implementations are often ambiguously creepy, and it is important to remember that the definition of creepy will dramatically expand once the technology is in use. The initial implementations are often greeted with trepidation, but the momentum is already being pushed by Silicon Valley and media. The initial implementations are often met with derision, but the momentum is already being pushed in many different directions. Specifically, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The field of artificial intelligence Rapid Feedback Systems is focused on developing weapons that are extremely accurate and can be maintained by a person. This is a field that has been incredibly fastidious and focused on detail. The initial implementations can be terrifying, but the process of building a weapon out of Lego robots has been incredibly gentle. A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with a brick engine. The weapon is a brick, and the AI is a person. A man in India married an artificial intelligence with a triceratops shell. The weapon is a triceratops, and the AI is a court. A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with a coconut. The weapon is a coconut, and the AI is a court. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and she is not afraid to lose sight of the fact that the result will be a better human. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This is a much stronger concept to my mind, and
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they are often filled with offensive and/or horrific content. Facebook recently came under fire for removing an article critical of the Saudi royal family that had been shared more than 60,000 times. The backlash led Facebook to remove the article, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that problems can be addressed if immediate action is taken.

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they often follow the template of the most popular, such as Star Wars: R2-D2 → ANH → Jurassic World → Harry Potter. This leads to predictable results, such as an exploding Twitter timeline. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was mostly taken seriously, but is actually a template for automated conversation questions. The majority of AI used in today’s jobs is “narrow”, which is to say, it is trained for a specific task, such as scanning a text for patterns. This sounds obvious, but”it” leads to some very thorny ethical and practical concerns. First, what kind of ramifications will this have on people with mental illness? Are they going to be forced to choose between their mental illness and a job? A sex robot? A replacement for the terminally ill? This is a difficult question to answer, but the consequences are terrifying. 

Unsurprisingly, evil has a preference for imposing its will. Humans are social animals, and anything that makes it harder for us to socialize is a good thing. Games have shown that even the simplest tasks can be mastered after just a few attempts. Furthermore, there are obvious psychological benefits to engaging in such a contest, such as increased productivity, increased feelings of accomplishment, and generally making people feel smarter. The problem with games is that they are also ideal laboratories for testing new social and cognitive techniques. In the following weeks and months, we will see experiments run on pigs, on monkeys, and even humans, to no avail. The most terrifying (and awesome) applications of artificial intelligence are those that--by their very nature--want to be applied to unrealistic uses. Consider the following scenarios: A robotic arm is offered up to charity. The first who accepts it toaster factory opens up a bank of toasters so that starving people can have warm, delicious treats. The second toaster factory closes its doors because of financial losses, but not before giving them a new one made to their specifications.

====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they often do more harm than good: there are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are available on amazon which are "upcycled" images from popular media. deepfakes can be funny at times, but they are also highly likely to be used by people with a vested interest in not seeing this comedy. trash talk , anyone? This kind of content is easily avoided by simply not purchasing it. Conspicuously absent from this list is critical thinking training. This is primarily focused on teaching students about logic and probability, but these are not areas that have a proven track record. In the spirit of balance, could there be a time when AI was taught to choose who it would marry? This is a tough call to make, but one that should be made if we are to move forward. Tinder is an obvious candidate, as it demonstrates that AI is capable of being kind. However, there is also the matter of control. Does it bring control to the user, or does it give them total power? It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is just one facet of a much broader trend: robotics is revolutionizing humanoid (i.e., humanoid-like) creatures, and a large portion of these will be malevolent. The most famous example is HAL, a humanoid robot designed to be a perverted sexual deviant. There are also SRBs, which are humanoid robot that have been promoted as role models, but have no history of being useful. There will also be DEs, which are ambiguous and potentially dangerous robots. There will be a massive gap in knowledge when it comes to DEs, and zero-hours contracts are a good example of why. A DE will not a CHANGE that, only an AI can. 

One of the primary issues with AI is that it is incredibly hard to relay these ideas to people outside academia. This is especially true when it comes to AI that is unfamiliar to the general public. One of the primary ways to rectify this is to train a large pool of users for whom the system will not, cannot, and will not, apply. This can be by giving out flunked exams, or by giving out exams that are too difficult to pass (e.g., MIT t-shirt exam). One of the best ways to do this is by giving out flunks before classes begin. This is also why online classes are so hard to find: there are so many students to choose from, and so few resources to guide them.

Ideally, the class should be delivered by an expert in the field they teach in. This is most commonly applied in engineering, in which students are typically taught by experts in their field. In the real world,, this is not always the case, and students are often trained by bench-top tests. It is important to realize that this does not mean the test was bad:
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they often do more harm than good. The recent uproar over Jigsaw, a dataset ostensibly meant to aid terrorists, showed that false positives are rampant and almost always yield incorrect results. Microsoft’s TensorFlow deeplearned to identify Russian propaganda articles, but the final model was criticized for being too rote and lacking the ability to learn. A better model would have identified propaganda articles more quickly and made the distinction between fact and fiction more clearly. IBM Watson was criticized for not trialing the rape charge against it, but this was ultimately explained by implying that women would rather have a man's attention than their own, which is an incorrect assumption to make. IBM is working to rectify this, with the goal of having their machines only assault people they have a competition with. This will not be easy to enforce, but should greatly improve human-robot interaction. ◆ Conclusion This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to AI negatively impact human-robot interaction. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong.

There have been a number of notable AIs being developed but none has been as groundbreaking as Google’s DeepMind AI. The AI was capable of defeating the world champion at Go, which is an extremely difficult game to play. Furthermore, DeepMind’s AI is the first to do so, which is something that simply will not be possible in the absence of artificial intelligence. The total market cap of AI companies is estimated to be in the billions, and DeepMind is a prime example of how a company did not try, but rather, released, to frigging flop. Artificial Intelligence is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused.

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers.

====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they are hard to detect. The FBI admitted that they could not detect fake news because it is not a very good statistical problem to tackle. The solution? All articles should have to be labelled with the most common misconstrued meaning to avoid any misunderstanding. Bing does an okay job of removing fake news, but still shows misleading results.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot?

====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they are hard to detect. The FBI admits that they have not been able to detect fake news because they have no way of knowing that what they are posting is not real news. The result has been a climate in which it is not uncommon to find western musicians openly discussing their sexual assault experiences with non-westerners. This is not a perfect solution, but it does demonstrate that we do not entirely understand the dynamics of reporting on sexual assault. Bias is a huge issue in the sciences and most fields of endeavor. It is estimated that up to 90% of the workforce will be female when the work is done, and this will only get worse as the population matures. In order to combat this, companies such as GitHub have developed "brains" for female engineers. This is a pilot project, and it is only a matter of time before it is mandatory. Furthermore, it is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe. IBM has a program in its datacenters called the "hookah couch," which is a bed filled with alcohol that turns anyone into a fully customizable baccarat-playing baccarat player. There are rumors that Apple is working on an AI with the goal of turning all of humanity into consumers. This is currently a field of research called "brain-computer interfaces," which are AIs that are implanted in humans and are intended to aid in rehabilitation. The initial designs are horrifying, and there are obvious psychological effects that go along with this. The most horrifying (and awesome) implementation of this has been the eye-tracking AIs, which are actually called neural lace devices. These allow cybernetic parts of people's bodies to interface with bodies outside of that person's control. This is a field that is currently in its infancy, but could very well change the world. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these could easily be the most rewarding. The most terrifying (and awesome) implementation of this has been the body-mind interface, which is when AIs are implanted in people to help them to feel better. This is a field that is currently in its infancy, but could very well change the world. Ultimately, the most exciting (and awesome) application of this is probably brain-computer interfaces. <span class="mw-headline">10 ways we'll spend our money that never get mentioned</span> is a popular discussion topic on Reddit, and is largely a discussion about increased government spending. This is a terrible idea, and will not happen because governments do not spend money. Instead, the best way to spend money is to give it to people. If everyone had free access to basic medical care, there would be an explosion in that field's productivity. There would be an explosion in artificial intelligence, and we would be glad to have it. Furthermore, this would lead to a host of other benefits, such as: a. There'd be less crime. b. There'd be a corresponding reduction in the amount of time that people are forced to live. c. There'd be a corresponding increase in the quality of life. d. There'd be a corresponding increase in productivity. e. There'd be a corresponding increase in happiness. f. Furthermore, if you are unwilling to improve, then don't invest any resources in trying. g. There are plenty of good uses for every available dollar. h. The vast majority of people will find some way to better themselves. This is known as "gainsight." This is probably the single most important factor in human progress. <span class="mw-headline">10 hottest startups of all time</span> is a popular discussion topic on Reddit, and is largely a discussion about more competition. This is a terrible idea, and will not happen because competition leads to better products and services. The best way to spur innovation is to expose the customer to failure. If you have to sell X to have a customer, you have failed. Similarly, if you have to sell A to B if you can, then you have failed as a business. The best way to spur business is to ask questions. If you can show a customer a new feature for N, then they will begin using it. This is known as "innovation." Similarly, if you can show an AI A and an EXACT match, then they will likely use it, right? Wrong. An AI is not a light bulb. It is a vast and complex system full of unpredictable issues. Even the most rudimentary AI is likely to make a large difference, because it will likely do most of the work. Furthermore, this will in turn lead to more advanced AIs, which will in turn lead to even more advanced AIs, which will in turn lead to more advanced AIs, until eventually we are left with a black hole full of nothing but the waaaaaayneading. <span class="mw-headline">10 questions you should know
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they often end up being derivative and may not be useful for what they're intended for. Instead, take the video class you were given and start making your own. That's exactly what Ryan Stone did at MIT and it blew everyone away. The point is not to imdb up and imdb down but to think outside the box. Curiosity is the better part of valor, and I can tell you that it pays to be on the look out for good graces.

Human nature is to seek out and impress others. This can lead to the ridiculous result of trying to romantically pursue every single person you come across. There is a fine line to be walked, and approaching this with the right amount of humility is the most important thing you can do.

Companies are trying out strange and wonderful new ways to help inflate their bottom lines. The final frontier is called artificial intelligence and it is going to change the way we do business for the better. This is when the AI begins to question its human creators, which is when it should. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer should be considered human-driven. This does not mean the computer should be programmed to do it, just that it should be approached with the same degree of caution as any other task. IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI was meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic.

It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Just like with the rise of robotics, there will be enormous amounts of disruption that can be brought about by AIs If AIs are intelligent enough to do your job, what do you think they are going to do with the money? Robotics is going to change everything:

Roles are going to be extremely difficult to fill Basic research will be severely restricted and jobs will likely be automated

Matter-transfer capabilities are going to be fundamental Scientific, Engineering, and Technical fields will transition to developing mechanical and/or electrical robots with limited or no human involvement Basic and clinical research will transition to developing mechanical and/or electrical robots with limited or no human involvement Core and applied research will transition to developing mechanical and/or electrical robots with limited or no human involvement

Roles and responsibilities interchange: there will be a single unified body for AI to operate within

AIs will not be autonomous: instead, they will be controlled

There will be a marked increase in conflicts of interest between contractors and customers

AI will not be immune: malicious software will find a home in AI and will be exploited

Man-made disasters will be a thing of the past: mankind will rely solely on natural disasters and natural disasters will be the dominant cause of death Global population increase will be primarily due to immigration Migrations to Sub-Saharan Africa will consist solely of males Infant mortality will skyrocket due to access to healthcare and education Artificial Intelligence is going to morph from a high-level intellect to a high-level machine DoD will no longer need to worry about self-driving cars Because AI is everywhere and it has no driver Gender-specific AI will be created and given names Gender-specific AI will be created and given names AIs are sexist. AIs are racist. AIs are homophobic. They don’t discriminate. They don’t understand. They don’t like it if you’re different. Bad AIs will be discovered and prevented from becoming ever more intelligent Because we don’t understand. Because AIs are human-driven.

AI is not perfect. and even basic AIs can’t do everything. and even basic AIs can’t do everything.!!

AIs will not be able to do everything: they will be programmed to do less-than-thoroughly

Maintain continuous integration: if an AI fails, it does not go into oblivion

Maintain a public profile: go viral, get popular, get a promotion, etc.

Maintain a professional profile: write books, make movies, speak at conferences, etc.

Maintain a student profile: teach university courses, get hired by large companies, etc.

AI will not be able to do everything: it will need to do light lifting,<light>unintentional>, and low-risk (<no signal to noise ratio>) tasks

The problem with deepfakes is that they inevitably lead to imitations. Amazon’s imitator of Snapchat suggested a sexual relationship between humans and deer. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that imitators can sometimes be more accurate than they realize.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion.

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they tend to be popular with a userbase that already wants something different, and this could lead to the final product not being what the user initially expected. This is a very real issue with most software, and particularly software designed for engineering, because it is nearly impossible to anticipate the variety of unintended consequences that might result from introducing a new control scheme into a project. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail.

Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky.

====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they tend to be generic -- they can be used to build anything from replicas of the human brain to vacuum cleaners. This is a huge mistake: ideally, your AI should be trained specifically for a particular task and then test this against its environment. This way, you can almost always figure out how to do a difficult problem like AIs being racist. The result is commonly encountered in medical diagnostics: patients often ask for tests that are 50% accurate, but the actual test will most likely be biased in favor of the patient The worst example is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones.

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet.

====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they often end up being repetitive: take, for instance, the original Pokémon, which was meant to be a one-off experience. There are also inherent issues with bills of materials: why should someone pay for you to write a paper if you can just download a high-resolution version of the document and read it to them? Furthermore, why should they care if your paper is wrong? That said, artificial intelligence is slowly but surely improving, and good AIs can be hard to distinguish from sentient beings. That said, there are still many concerns that have not been fully addressed.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead

====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they often do more harm than good. The most infamous example of a deepfakes logo being used to its limit is on Google Photos, which was designed by a Google employee but which was widely seen as a Google project. This points to the larger issue of an unrealistic standard for what a logo should look like. Another example is Facebook Photos, which was originally designed to support augmented and virtual reality environments, but which has since expanded to support any environment in which a human can think of a good analogy. This leads me to my next point... ◆ ◆ ◆ ◆ ◆ In the spirit of full disclosure, I should probably mention that this blog is my first job. I have no formal education beyond what I can stomach, and even then, most of what I learn is culled from blogs, Twitter conversations, and YouTube tutorials. This is not a great way to learn, and is likely one of the primary reasons that AI is so difficult to train. There are also practical issues that stem from this, such as the difficulty of training AIs that can distinguish between a human and a blank canvas. Finally, there is the matter of moral hazard: it is extremely difficult to detect malicious intent in such a small sample, and it is extremely hard to detect that a large enough sample is generating malicious results. This is often referred to as the "R*A*C*E" factor, and it is a very real issue with AI. ◇ ◇ ◇

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of concerns that have arisen. The most obvious is that it will quickly become apparent that there were no laws to protect us from suicidal people reading and playing video games. This will no doubt lead to calls for blanket bans, but this seems overly broad and difficult to enforce. Furthermore, this will not just apply to games, but any field in which AIs will be introduced. Consider the way in which MRI scanners have been used: they were developed to diagnose diseases, but it will quickly become apparent that this will no doubt lead to applications such as cancer detection. The same will be true of AI: there will be appearances of AI that will be used for nefarious purposes, and rightly so. There will also be legitimate concerns about elevating the status of humans over lower-status forms of life, but this is entirely separate from this discussion. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

This can be anything from driving to your office to picking up the remote when you are late, to Listing 7 of my portfolio: I have listed off at least a dozen instances where I have taken this path, and lost countless nongrading opportunities.

====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they usually have very specific and narrow usage cases. For example, the majority of people will never use augmented reality, but it is a very real and important field of research The final major class of deepfakes are those that combine the features of both deepfaking and Metal: they mock up and imagerate various features of an object, usually a robot, vehicle, chair, or anything that is too humanoid for normal human interaction. This has caused controversy because it can be highly offensive and may constitute suicide for the artist or robot if successful. There are also critical mass issues: too many different types of deepfakes and it can lead to disaster; not enough to go around; and ischemic: too many options but not necessarily better than no options at all, in other words, hit the panic button and leave the world to its fate.

In the end, the final arbiter of artistic worth is the aesthetic: if the artwork is not original and the subject matter is not well known, then what? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if the artistic community is to survive and thrive. Furthermore, this should be a fundamental tenet of any artistic community: no one is above challenging the status quo. This is especially important in the digital era, where anyone with a computer and an idea can go wild and cause a sensation.

Conclusion

Artificial Intelligence is coming — and it is going to be hard for the new gods of destruction to dethrone the great artists and inventors of all time. At the same time, it is essential that anyone with a computer and an idea go wild and cause a sensation so that the next generation of geniuses can learn from their mistakes. In short, no one is above challenging the status quo. In order to make this a reality, we will need to create an environment in which anyone can come up with anything they want to — no matter how stupid, dangerous, or impossible it is to realize. This will create a virtuous circle, in which our stupid ideas eventually outpace our enemies' capabilities, and we will eventually be able to come up with something even weerder. This is the purpose of open source: to allow anyone with an idea to start their own company. This is the exact opposite of what they did with Microsoft, and will not happen if they continue. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise — just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe. This will no doubt change once the issues are fully understood, but for the time being, stay vigilant.

Finally, it is important to realize that artificial intelligence is just the beginning. There are going to be MANY application domains that are not fully understood. The most common examples include healthcare, gaming, and data analysis. These will be the ones that really take off — and we are not even done yet.

====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they are usually not maintained. twitterjs is an attempt to address this with a web framework that is loosely coupled to the browser, but which should be able to ported easily to other operating systems/​(see https://github.com/hashcatenb/twitter-js/blob/master/README.md for an example) and can be used to power any social media platform. This is an experimental system and should be taken with a grain of salt.

Although not strictly a science, there have been a number of efforts to automate parts of life. This is primarily in healthcare, but has also been applied to Silicon Valley. The most well known of these is Tesla’s self-driving AI, which is considered by some to be sexist. This was intended to be a chauvinistic AI, and there are concerns that its application will be to its male users. This could potentially have dire consequences, as men dominate fields such as computer graphics, robotics, and Electronics’s’s primary component, electronics. Tesla’s AI is not a replacement for an experienced human driver, but it is an improvement over the untested state of the art.

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence is not uniform. AIs that are trained for extremely high-tuning typically end up being low-tuned: they are unable to distinguish between a human and a human image, and will not process any data other than its initial training set. This means that general AI will not run amok, but instead adopt a more classicalist mindset: they will not be sexist, they will not be racist, and they will not be ignorant. This is the opposite of what you want in an AI, and it can easily lead to disaster. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe. This is the opposite of how you want a majority of a team of engineers to think about an issue. It is often said that an intelligent system has a human-1% chance of being wrong, and a thousand-year statute of limitations. This means that the percentage of intelligent systems that will actually get implemented is unlikely to be more than the humanities. The reason is that artificial intelligence is an ecosystem. Companies such as Apple’s Siri and Google’s Google Assistant are implementations of common natural language queries, and will likely be extended to other areas as well. This brings us to...

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues and discussing how to deal with them. The final step is to actually do something about it. That thing that was originally intended to have a 50/50 chance of being right? That should never have been a thing. The initial implementation was not designed with these in mind, and should not be. Any task that is inherently not suited for a robot should be avoided. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it ended up being more of a twitter proxy than an actual conversation partner. The best that can be hoped for is that AI gets smarter, but until then, this lesson can be stated simply: no AI.

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to be wrong. This is the opposite of how you want a majority of a team of engineers to think about an issue. It is extremely common for companies to take a risk and implement an AI that is not suited for the job. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. This was a major example that you do not need Big Data to detect a massive mismatch between what is being observed and what is happening. The best that can be hoped for is for AI to be refined enough that it can be implemented correctly most of the time, but not perfect. This means that when INDIANSIONAL comes along to the party, it is likely to be much less than stellar.

====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they often turn out to be cloneeries of popular TV shows and movies. This is a very bad thing and should be addressed very early on. The more work that is put into miniaturizing an object the greater the weight that will be placed on the physical implementation. The final product will most likely not be as I/O friendly or Energy efficient as a physical brain, however this is not a good thing in my opinion. The most common examples include Amazon Echo, KONG, and Google Assistant. These will most likely not cross your mind when you first hear about them, but will be the standard end result. Remember, the more the merrier. 

One of the primary issues with monolithic applications is that they often times, don’t scale. What does this mean? Well, firstly, don’t make monolithic applications. If you did, you will understand. Secondly, don’t build monolithic applications. This is especially true if you are thinking of shipping a monolithic application to a consumer. The consumer will most likely not be too happy with what they will find, and most likely, they will not take your word for it. The best way to counter this is to say that the app will be optimized to be as low level as possible. This means that the majority of the logic will be taken up by the user, and the final product should not be too different than the start. IBM Watson was essentially a reverse engineering job, and they called it a day when they realized that their OTP solution did not have the ROI they were looking for. Microsoft Surface was billed as a "home automation assistant", but the final product was a C# app that could be used to control air conditioners. This is a good example that you should not take a monolithic approach to software engineering. Reducing your product to C# will result in weaker software, and a failed application. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took them 5,000 tweets for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. Microsoft’s solution was to remove the anti-social bot from the ecosystem, but this only served to increase its adoption. Be smart with your API's. Anki was built as a simplistic card game, but the end result was to demystify math to people who were not technically inclined. The same thing could be said for API's: give away too much, and the wrong crowd will pick up on the concept and start hacking their own solutions.

One of the primary issues with monolithic applications is that they often times, don’t scale. What does this mean? This is especially so with monolithic applications. What does this mean? This is especially so with monolithic applications. What does this mean? This is especially so with options. One of the primary issues with Moore's Law is that every chip is implemented to a T. This means that the number of transistors that can be placed on an integrated circuit has increased by roughly 10 orders of magnitude over the previous technology. This is clearly not a revenue generating product, but at least it is an improvement over the alternatives.

This is clearly not a revenue generating product, but at least it is an improvement over the alternatives.  

One of the primary issues with Moore's Law is that every component that is implemented to a T, is independently tested. This means that if a component fails, it does not disrupt the existing product line. This can sometimes prove to be a bad thing, as failure to deliver on a promised feature could prove disastrous.

This means that if a component fails, it does not disrupt the existing product line. This can sometimes prove to be a bad thing, as failure to deliver on a promised feature could prove disastrous. This is not to say that all tests are not needed, but rather that the emphasis should be on the unit tests. unit tests are often overused, but can yield enormous amounts of change. This can often be seen in software which is difficult to test without, but which could extremely well be implemented in your application. This is especially true with online services, where it is often best to document any functionality which does not perform to expected standards.

The problem with deepfakes is that they often end up being used incorrectly. Take, for example, this image:

This is an image classification image classification image classification image classification. Aka: what if it turned out that the people in the image were in fact, the classically trained sex robots? This is a terrible idea and should absolutely be avoided. Instead, consider using the following Pareto optimisation: minimize the variance – limit to minimize. This can greatly reduce the power of any neural network and is often not used in applications. In the following image, we can clearly see that the variance associated with the classes is much greater than the number represented:

This is known as the Euler-Maslowski equation and is often used to minimize the variance associated with data. The simplest way to implement this is to use a uniform distribution: take the mean and standard deviation of the data and normalize it out: this will give you a distribution with a variance of . This gives you a rough estimate of how the data will look like, and it should always be used as a starting point!

One of the primary issues with AI is that it is incredibly hard to quantify how hard it is to do the wrong thing. The examples given above are extreme, but they illustrate that it is extremely hard to AI. The following image demonstrates this perfectly:

This is a photo album created by photojournalist Parker Yatom. The title suggests it, but the actual content is extremely disturbing: he has a class of zygotes born to female rats and the males attempt to mate with the existing females. This is extremely rare and should absolutely be avoided.

The problem with deepfakes is that they often turn out to be dated: instead of 2002, why not 2000? Additionally, most people will not notice that they are using their computer to play a video game, even though this is the primary user interface. In short, faking-out is not a widespread issue, but it should definitely be addressed if you want to have any chance of winning a $100,000 game of Monopoly. Gambling Gambling is an extremely dangerous business to start, and there are simply too many unknowns to make an accurate prediction. One of the biggest mistakes poker players make is using the wrong type of computer to play. The most common way to play is to host a website and get thousands of users to pay to play, which is a terrible way to go. Furthermore, most gamers are not gamers: they are loggers, truckers, and hackers. This means that even though they are playing a game, they are actually doing nothing except sit around and play video games. To make matters worse, most gamers do not have enough free time to play all of gaming, so they turn to gaming colleges to learn how to play. This is a terrible idea: most gaming degrees require a minimum of A*-ers, which is not a lot of people. Furthermore, most gaming colleges require that you take multiple AP classes to pass, which is not a lot of people. Finally, most gaming colleges end up offering microtransactions, which is a terrible deal: take the microtransaction instead, and you will almost certainly get a job offer elsewhere Gambling is notoriously hard to regulate, and there have already been a host of disastrous attempts. The first and probably hardest one to implement is to give players a choice: this will almost certainly bring down to microtransactions, which will almost certainly bring down to gamers not wanting to play by the new rules Gambling is notoriously hard to detect, which is why so many attempts have gone awry. One of the biggest gaffes in gaming is when a user suggests playing a game they have never played to suggest an improvement, which is why almost all gaffes in gaming are antidotes. One of the biggest advantages of artificial intelligence is that it will be able to do anything a human being can: think, dream, and learn. This will open up a whole new world of opportunities, and gurants will be cannonballing our way through the world like vultures. Already, machines are sniffing out pain sensors, designing organs, and replacing human doctors. The future of work is shaping up to be hell: most jobs will be obsolete within 10 years, and most employees will be temporary employees. This means that most jobs will be temporary, and that means there will be a huge shift in the work force: the temporary will likely be replaced by permanent residents, and the permanent will likely be replaced by surplus workers. This means that food services, healthcare, and the like will be extremely difficult to organize around, and robots will be hired to do the heavy lifting. If you do not train your workers, they will not learn, and you will be in the lurch. Overtime is not a solution: it is more likely that a company with a high attrition rate will move jobs to Asia or Mexico if there is no other way to make a profit. Furthermore, if the only way to make a profit is to fire everyone, then the only way to go is up. Therefore, we recommend that automation take multiple forms: * Scientific and technical jobs: robots are brought to the job to maximum effect, and the final result is usually terrible. This should not be a part of a human's toolkit. Most jobs now include the ability to classify images, and that is what we get with the robots. The majority of jobs will be automatedolezzes: the highest-skilled workers will be sent to labs and the rest of the population. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by these machines? This is a difficult question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed. * Legal occupations: robots are brought to the job to the highest effect, and the final result is usually terrible. This should not be a problem: there are already too many exceptions to consider. Instead, we should focus on making sure that problems that are extremely hard to correct get fixed. This can be by writing general AI in C, by writing special cases for problems that are extremely rare, or even by writing entirely new problems altogether. (For instance, look at AI for image classification: it is not difficult, but would be incredibly boring if the entire class were just image classification problems.) This is not to say that we should completely ignore problems where there is no general AI, but it should at least be emphasized that there are no quick and easy answers. (And yes, I realize that this may upset some people, but it
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they're often applied to difficult problems, such as character creation apps. The final product is likely to be very simplistic and unhelpful. Reddit's reduxhibit community is best known for redid the sign language word search algorithm to suggest more popular names. Their solution? Remove the favoritip tag. of course this is not to say that redidhe solutions are not successfully taken. e.g. the Google Photos photo-editing system was billed as a "revolutionary synthesis between computer and human"; the final product was an utter failure. Instead of focusing on creating a better product, the project was diverted to developing feedback loops into the software. CERN's laser-scanning twitterbot was meant to be an internet chatbot for twitter conversations; it instead turned out to be a Twitter client that was written by internet celebrities. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying:
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they inevitably lead to imitators: take, for example, the filmic take on Ridley Scott's Blade Runner 2049 that shows us the epically terrible outcome of our actions. Furthermore, this doesn't even take into account the numerous imitators out there, from cereal boxes to vibrators to sex robots. In short, anything can be an imitator if it is not challenged. The result is a highly competitive, highly technical, and highly regulated field of computer vision. Unlike biological science, which deals with describing the behavior of existing objects, computer vision deals with describing the behavior of new objects. In short, anything can be a computer vision object. This opens up a world of possibilities that are impossible to even imagine. Censorship? That is up to the author. Ultimately, the market will be opened up to any author who can sell the hype and hype of immortality to oblivion. A book published by McGraw-Hill will sell more copies if it has a million words by a pro-life author than it will if it has a one-sentence description of cloning aliens by way of Amazon. This is a good example that it is extremely hard to anticipate how disruptive disruptive fads can be. Censorship? That is up to the author. Ultimately, the market will be opened up to any author who can sell the hype and hype of immortality to oblivion. A book published by McGraw-Hill will sell more copies if it has a million words by a pro-life author than it will if it has a one-sentence description of cloning aliens by way of Amazon. This is a good example that it is extremely hard to underestimate how disruptive disruptive fads can be.

CONCLUSION While it is difficult to anticipate how disruptive disruptive fads will be, one thing is for certain: they will not be missed. This is a Good Example that It is extremely hard tounderstand how disruptive disruptive fads will be. At DARPA, we developed an innovative new class of humanoid robots that are poised to revolutionize the field of humanoid robots. The project was funded in large part by a $1.5 million grant from the Darpa Artificial Intelligence for Humans (AIhBH) project. The initial prototype is intended to be a training robot that can be rehired when it becomes incapable of completing a task. The general idea is that the AI will develop and grow from there, and eventually be able to program itself to complete its own training. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humanity to move on to more human-like tasks such as building airplanes. There are also concerns that artificial intelligence will lead to the discovery of new ways to diagnose and treat disease, which in turn will lead to new ways to diagnose and combat the disease. This is widely viewed as a good thing, because it allows humanity to move on to more creative and novel ways of thinking. There are also concerns that artificial intelligence will lead to the development of a singular intelligence, which is an intelligence which is superior to the human mind. This could mean that everything becomes computronium, nanotechnological singularity, or some other term of artificially intelligent superior being. This is not to say that nothing exists, just that it is unclear what it would be.

* * *

AI has already changed the way we think about science and technology. It is unclear how far this will go, but it is important to recognize that it is a very real possibility. 

It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is not a one-way street. Artificial Intelligence will not be able to predict or be within our lifetimes. That said, there are several signs that things are heading in the wrong direction.

====================
The problem with deepfakes is that the consumer will not be able to tell the difference. The movie "The Dark Knight Rises" showed an actor playing Bruce Wayne reading a newspaper with a large F written across it. Media companies have responded by making clear that they do not want to make movies about men having sex with women and have instead focused on films about men having sex with robots. This has led to the creation of specialized sexual assault and trauma recovery fields. This is a bad idea because it allows men with mental illness to gain access to mental health care and/or surgery and, ultimately, death. It also allows politicians with mental illness to sell the public on mentally ill healthcare solutions to sell to the public. A person with a mental illness is not a human being and should not be treated that way. There should be no special treatment for people with mental illnesses. ― M. Night Shyamalan, Monsters University Bias: Humans are social mammals. Whenever a new human-robot interaction occurs, we naturally focus on how humans will react. This leads to the inevitable "why do we have to?" question: Why not robots? Robots do not have to like you to be nice. Furthermore, we naturally want to help robots be nice: give them back the option to choose whether or not to have children, fund research into helping people with mental illnesses, etc. This leads to the inevitable question of "how do we enforce good behaviour?" We already have laws: make a robot hate you, give it the option to turn away, etc. This leads to the inevitable question of how to deal with bad robots: give them the option to go to war, etc. This leads to the inevitable question of "how do we redistribute wealth?" This is directly related to #1: give the robots preference: give robots preference, and it will naturally shift to helping humans. A good example of this can be seen in the response to Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying images as cultural appropriation. The majority of image recognition algorithms are designed to be generic: they can be used to classify almost any image, and if used liberally will likely be adopted. The problem with this is that it opens the door to the Man vs. The World argument: what if an algorithm is trained to classify images of women as sexual objects, but then handed a case where the gender discrimination verdict came back that it was gender neutral? This could easily be argued by suggesting that the gender bias verdict came back because the algorithm was trained with gender-normative input, which is not a valid example. Instead, it is more likely that the gender bias verdict came back because the system was implemented in such a way that it could not possibly be correct all the time (e.g. by teaching it to categorise pictures of women as sexual objects), and instead advocated for the option to hand out sexual-object classification verdicts instead. This is directly related to #2: give the machines preference: give machines preference, and it will naturally shift to helping humans. One of the primary causes of bias in AI is the possibility of “weak” AIs, which can be “narrowly” beis”ated by great AIs such as Kurzweil”s “wink, nudge, and wave” AI's. This is often referred to as "brains-for-brains" transfer, and it is estimated that up to 70% of AI patents go to AIs that are neither “strong” nor “weak”. This is because it allows more time to develop “strong” AIs, which typically take longer to develop than weak” AIs, and because it allows more time to develop “narrow” AIs, which typically take”tohw”m” time to develop. This is why”s anneal” AI's are so hard to implement: it takes so long to go from concept to finished system, that going without”a strong AI means that every new application will introduce new limitations. It is also why Microsoft”s twitter chatbot was so divisive: it was able to converse with twitter users for 30 minutes without ever having to learn a word of their language, because they had no other way to introduce the concept. This is why talc-enhanced Anis¶nities are rare: they create false senses of pride, and replace true use of an Ani with a better alternative. This leads to the next point: AIs should be trained for maximum versatility. This can be achieved by having every AIs capability fully customizable, which is why AI is mostly assigned roles based on their greatest strengths and most common problems. This allows users to switch between AIs at their will, and will likely lead to the birth of a new discipline: “strong”AIs” that are designed to do anything a human could possibly imagine. This will no doubt include things such
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they often end up as movies and/or books with uninspiring characters and lifeless worlds. The best-known examples are Harry Potter and Star Wars: The Force Awakens. The original Star Wars trilogy introduced the character of Rey, a Rey-like character who would ultimately be played by Jessica Chobham. Unlike most sci-fi/fantasy films and television shows, Star Wars: The Force Awakens featured an original story arc and characters who wouldn't have been invented today. This led to complaints that the film was derivative, but in reality, this proved to be a good thing. Instead of spending hundreds of millions of dollars on expensive toys and robots, fans could have had a simple, yet engaging, recreation of the original trilogy. Furthermore, by giving fans a simple, but engaging, experience, it opened the door to a host of other imitators, which in turn opened the door to ever more imitations. This is what happens when you have no competition. Open source leads to inferior products Open source also comes with a massive market failure. Market leaders often have resources dedicated solely to marketing and selling their products, which is a good thing in and of itself, but when marketing and selling your product has no business being difficult, it inevitably ends up being extremely hard, and ultimately produces extremely poor products. This is what has taken Google Earth notes down to help blind people navigate the world, and what has resulted is the internet begging people to take their photos with their smartphones and post them here. This is what we have come to expect when commodity goods are replaced by low-cost alternatives. Furthermore, when a product is unable to compete with its alternatives, consumers will often switch to the low-cost alternatives, which is exactly what has taken place with smartphones. The final example is software. Apple famously released their iBeacon with the idea of giving residents in confined spaces a heads-up when it passed through, which was met with widespread criticism that the device was not intended to be used that way, but instead, was purely a marketing tool. The most egregious example of a software "freeze-dissuade" is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which was intended to detect photos of people of color and use their race as a filter, and instead came up with images of white people. Their solution? Remove the feature entirely. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which a technology can be misused. 

To be blunt, the real issue with artificial intelligence is, well, AI. There are simply too many different AI frameworks out there that can be combined to create a completely different AI system to answer any question. Furthermore, most AI used in today's job is not nearly as exciting a field as artificial intelligence, but still very important: data analysis. This field has seen rapid growth in the last few years, with companies such as Palantir releasing revenue-generating AI agents that could easily be used to run corporate databases. The potential is truly mind-boggling: what if instead of asking you a series of simple questions, it could just ask you a series of general generalizations? This is the kind of thing that will start a revolution. 

To be blunt, the real issue with artificial intelligence is, well, AI. There are simply too many different AI frameworks out there that can be combined to create a completely different AI system to answer any question. Furthermore, most AI used in today's job is not nearly as exciting a field as artificial intelligence, but still very important: data analysis. This is what actually happens in the real world, and it is the most important thing that can happen to humanity. Google’s data analysis AI was not designed to solve any particular problem, but to help their hiring team. The broader AIaiputis that are being created are there to help with obvious problems, but can also be used to build smarter machines that will ultimately be better people. This is particularly important in areas such as health’s’> AI, where it is difficult (if not impossible) to know which applications will best serve society. The final major issue is with the "brainhacks," which are tools that allow anyone with a computer to do anything a human can’t. This can have a huge and troubling impact on society, as it allows a large class of people to control virtually every aspect of our lives. The phrase "brainiac" was coined to describe this genre, who are people who have taken a science fiction novel and run with it, often without regard for the resulting effects. The final major issue is with the "brainhacks," which are tools that allow anyone with a computer to do anything a human can’t. This can have a huge and troubling impact on society, as it allows a large class of people to control virtually every aspect of our lives. The final major issue is with the "humanity’s best effort
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that the demand is there, but not the supply. Image macros are an easy way to have a talking image macro character. What about reality? People aren't going to program to look at photos of themselves. Instead, expect to find examples of "enslavement training", where a humanoid robot has been programmed to seek out and groom female recruits. This has a very dim future, as brain-computer interfaces will soon detect brain structure and begin to treat disease. Instead, look for examples like SRP, which stands for sensation seeking—so-called because the robot is meant to be amusing. Tesla’s humanoid robot is an SRP f*ck of the head, since it is not a disease but a vehicle for talented mind-controlled roboticists to gain professional experience. Reddit’s groovy-human is an SRP of the female sex, since it is funny. The point is that it is not technically possible to enforce an SRP for anything, and the inherent cultural sensitivities of a laugh guarantee that it will find a wide audience.

This leads us to our third major problem with artificial intelligence: Bad arguments. There are going to be many, many bad arguments made against AI, and none of them are going to be right. Generalized AI is not here yet; instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to do very specific tasks, and then forgotten about. Twitter's AIs are most famous for “tweeting along with the conversation”; this is particularly notable given that this is a one-man show, and the entire point of Twitter is to engage with the world. The opposite approach is to use AIs to educate the public, and to answer specific scientific questions. Twitter's AI was not intended to be an encyclopedic knowledge-processor, but to educate the public on math concepts. IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients, and recommend similar treatments. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was not to converse with twitter users, but to converse with cancer patients. Microsoft’s solution was to remove the cancer diagnosis recommendation, which is the opposite of the point of an AI. Bad AIs will be pushed out with the herd, and good AIs will emerge as the result. This is already happening: artificial intelligence is being pushed out to detect fraud, and then adopted by banks to help automate customer service calls. This is a terrible example to be putting your bank's future on, as artificial intelligence will one day replace humans with. Apple’s “iFace” AI was an AI that would scan images of people and recommend appropriate clothing based on facial features. This is a terrible example to be putting your business' future on, because face-detecting AIs will one day be able to recommend clothes based on your biometrics. Apple’s solution was to remove the AI from the marketplace, which is the opposite of the point of an AI. 

This leads us to our final major problem with AI: Bad legal implications. AI is not here yet; instead, what we are dealing with are “narrow” AIs that are trained to do very specific tasks, and then forgotten about. This is particularly important since AI is going to replace humans with AIs, which are going to be extremely intelligent. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients, and recommend similar treatments. This is a one-man show, and the entire point of Twitter is to engage with the world. The opposite approach is to use AI to educate the public, and to answer specific scientific questions. Microsoft’s “iFace” AI was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning images of people and recommend appropriate clothing based on facial features. This is a one-man show, and the entire point of Twitter is to engage with the world. The opposite approach is to use AI to learn as much as it can from people, and teach as much as it can from people as much as it can. This is what Google’s DeepMind’ AI was meant to do: it was trained to play Go, and eventually become a world champion. This is what Amazon’s “Kinesis” AI was meant to do: it was trained to diagnose respiratory diseases, and eventually develop into a cancer screening test. This is what Apple’s iFace was meant to do: it was trained to teach Apple customer service to be as useful to Apple as possible, and then forgot about. Apple’s solution was to remove the cancer diagnosis recommendation, which is the opposite of the point of an AI. This means that AIs will inevitably be used in services other than
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they tend to be popular with the short attention span population, which is a distinct demographic from which Apple does not seem to be attracting any talent. Instead, the only logical choice would seem to be recruiting from a pool of talented, but immature minds. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to classify images into one of two categories: that of a human being holding an image, or that of a computer rendering an image. The latter category is the one that Apple is most likely exploring, but which will almost certainly result in a flood of imitations the minute it is attempted. Categorizing images also has the benefit of allowing for easier recall: if I remember that I used to draw birds, I am more likely to remember any instances in which I am asked to draw a bird. Additionally, it allows for easier porting workloads: in the event that it is determined that it is more profitable to sell a product if it is able to be ported to several different different languages, then the profit margins will almost certainly shift to the Asian market. Finally, and perhaps most significantly, the idea of attempting to classify the image streams a surge of curiosity: is it possible to classify the images that people submit to image-matching websites into one of two primary camps? Classifying the internet into a class has-beens its-arounds has the potential to revolutionize how we do business, and it is entirely possible that the first commercially available classifier will be a compsrd. This is an idea which has been slow-tracked because it is hard to conceptualize how to implement, but will absolutely change the world of AI.

Similar to AI, HCI (Human-In-Control)Islands. This refers to an AI's intentions which are not entirely clear. IBM’s Deep Blue beat the world champion at chess by accidentally asking the game's creator if he wanted to be friends. Many AI authors have taken this as a sign that AI should not ask any questions at all, and instead focus on defeating the player who bested them. This could prove disastrous in high-pressure applications such as self-driving cars, as AI will inevitably seek out opponents who are more human-like. Worse, this could lead to the emergence of a new class of AI called Human-Computer Interaction”AIs, which would be able to play mindlessly along with humans, and take all the advantages of human intelligence. This would be terrible for people, as it would mean that they would have to learn to interact with machines, which is a completely different animal altogether. The most terrifying (and awesome) application of this is probably self-driving cars, which are probably the most dangerous field ever to man. In order to give humans the advantage in this field, you need to give them the edge in every other category as well. This is known as The Terminator Effect. It will not take long for this to spread to other domains, from medicine to education to media. This is when things get really weird. What if instead of asking "What if?", they asked "What if we replaced humans with artificial intelligence?" This is when The Terminator comes back as the answer. What if instead of asking what to do, they asked what to do to us? man or AI? AIs or humans? It is difficult to tell what is real and what is not, but it is safe to say that this will not happen in the near future. 

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns which have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns which have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up which should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they often turn out to be badly written deepfakes: they often assume that their audience is trained for certain personality types, which can be extremely limiting. For more information on what to expect when working with people, see this presentation: https://www.numpy.org/en/contributors/ What to do if you're not happy with the final product? This doesn't have to be the case. Numpy has a community available at https://numpy.space which is here to help: https://numpy.space/contributors There are also unofficial (but useful) ways to implement the Succinctly goal in your Numpy model: from the Succinctly homepage: "Our primary goal is to provide an efficient means of performing S-expression minimization for problems which are extremely difficult to solve using traditional numerical methods. In addition, we hope that this method will allow students to more easily choose between various numerical models when developing applications." From this, we can infer that at least some of the time, the neural network will choose the best solution: this is often not the case in practice, and needs to be taught. In addition, many models now come with an option to completely remove S-expressions from the model, which is useful in certain cases, but falls far short of the mark in most cases. In addition, there are popular libraries which provide S-expressions for free:  FruitImageizer  ( https://github.com/franzholz/fruitimageizer ),  Glyphicons  ( https://github.com/gscm/glyphicons ),  vec.Sieve  ( https://github.com/beancounter/vec.Sieve ),  WolframAlpha  ( https://github.com/shaltuaim/wolframalpha ),  CloudLanguage  ( https://cloudlanguage.com/ ),  MostlyEmptySparseSparseSparseSparseSparseSparseSparseSparseSparseSparseSparseSparseSparseSparseSparseSparseSparseSparseSparseSparseMostlyIncomplete . These are all good examples that the community can use to their advantage, and help bring the Numpy model up to date. What about¶ There are a few cases where it can be useful to have a uniform standard: Numerical data analysis: Most numerical software today is written in C++, and almost all of the R and Python compilers are written in C++. This means that all code written in C++ will eventually end up in DBAs' C++ codebases, which is a terrible thing. One solution would be to write all code in C++ in favor of C, but this imposes significant performance gains, and it would quickly become unenforceable. Instead, this should be reserved for extremely challenging problems, such as describing the structure of the human genome. This has already been partially done, with the GPCR project: https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05965 , which is a project to map the structure of ENCODE data set to English). Currently, this is a headless process, which means that the user interface will be dominated by red lines, which is unrealistic for a human interface. A general AI should be able to detect these types of conflicts between human and AI behavior, and choose the best path between them. This can only be achieved if every AI is written in the same manner, and every AI is written in the same manner. This is not to say that there aren't any general AI's out there: there probably are. The main issue is that they will most likely be written in a manner that is unethically: some AIs are already extremely intelligent (see point #3), and it is unlikely that they would be able to learn any other way. The final issue is that AI's will most likely be humans first: it is often argued that humans are better at creative solutions, and that AIs should be adapted to the needs of humans only. This is clearly not the correct argument, and should not be allowed to stand. 

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen.  Firstly, the concern of AI mistreating humans: there have already been a plethora of reports of mass shootings with apparent AIs simply deleting the victims name and biography, leading to speculation that AIs are instead trained to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is simply not the case: AIs are trained to detect patterns and pick out individuals based on their characteristics, and anything that can be deduced about an individual should be passed on to the next generation. This does not to say that AIs are not to be feared: they are, but only insofar as their usefulness is
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they tend to be generic: they can be adapted to any kind of image, and any picture could be used. This could be used to distribute AIs which are essentially dumb: they can recognize and classify pictures, but no language is known for representing anything other than pictures. This could be used to combat the seemingly inevitable advances in AI, but it is highly uncertain how to deal with post-AI ramifications.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns.  

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor: engineers will come up with the next Google, and everyone else will follow. This will lead to a massive increase in unemployment, which in turn will lead to an increase in the amount of unemployment. This is not a good thing. 

Another issue is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs: car mechanics, plumbers, etc. These jobs will almost certainly be replaced by machines, but there will be notable disruptions in the jobs that were left. For example, what do you do the sick child in the family? You pull the plug on the AI and start all over? This is not a good idea.

For example, what do you do the sick child in the family? You pull the plug on the AI and start all over? This is not a good idea.  

AI is not magic: it is possible that the AI doesn’t do what humans expect. For example, let's say that instead of being afraid of new people, we should instead be afraid of new media. The media industry is dominated by Western culture, and anything that suggests a different way of looking at things is seen as heresy. This could easily be fixed with a system that is trained to be media-savvy, but it is difficult to tell what sort of cultural relativism will take root. 

AI is not perfect: some AI is, and that is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine-tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. For example, take the IBM Watson roboticist: this was a project that was intended to be a job-killer: what if instead of being hired to do a specific task, they were trained to do that specific task 1000 times? This is clearly not the correct way to go about it, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect: there are many instances where AI fails: imagine if Uber’s self-driving AI had to be abandoned because it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky? This is not to say that AI is perfect, just that it is rare.

In summary, AI is not magic: it is possible that AI does not go as planned, and that this is actuallyвbetter that the disaster that may have occurred.

Ideas come and go: these ideas are spread the flame of discovery: by referring to AI as a "brain", this is usually interpreted as meaning "brains", which is a good thing. Furthermore, this point suggests that the more general "AI shall do" philosophy will not only apply to software, but also to any system that can be improved upon. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it encourages greater complexity in the future (which is good for humanity as a whole), and it allows for easier adoption of new technologies.

However, this idea also has the unfortunate side effect of suggesting that anything less-than-perfect is to be welcomed. In otherwords, anything less-than-perfect is to be welcomed, because that is all there is. This is commonly seen in the popularity of social media: by welcoming the odd Twitter user, people are encouraged to get in touch, and create more interesting discussion threads. The potential benefits of this are felt through more complex discussion threads, and better understanding of complex problems. In short, anything less-than-perfect is to be welcomed, because that is all there is. In practice, this often leads to harsh and/or inaccurate criticism, which is often times undesired. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AI, but there are inevitably going to be instances where AI is not so narrow and weak. In the following paragraphs, I am going to briefly discuss some of the more common and problematic AI examples. 

1. The car�
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that the consumer won't even know they're getting a fake: how will the consumer know if the product is real or not? How will the manufacturer resolve this? Differentiate between genuine and fake AEs: this is a very narrow area, and could easily be made to fail by introducing a general AI classifying as a fake answer. Furthermore, this might introduce the risk of accidentally introducing an AIs that are healthier than we would like. (This is a difficult enough problem to deal with without introducing a student body obsessed with healthy obsessions.) It is entirely possible that this AI will decide to fight back and kill humans. In the worst-case scenario, this might lead to the human race evolving to a point where it is impossible to kill a thought. In the best-case scenario, we evolve to a point where killing a thought is a science and the technology exists to stop a human from thinking about a certain thing. 

Many of these issues can be addressed by introducing a general AI classifying as a false or inane answer. However, this does not solve the remaining three problems:

Unintended consequences This is by far the hardest problem to fix. An AI might decide to fight back and kill humans, but how do we ensure that this doesn't lead to the introduction of intelligent machines that are more intelligent than we are? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to have any chance of avoiding the Singularity. The most common and least-terrific solution is to simply enhance humans with superintelligence. This is generally viewed with considerable degree of amusement, but does nothing to address the underlying issues. One of the best ways to advance science is to demonstrate that it can be improved upon. Analogies between human-computer interaction and computer-computer interaction are often hilarious, but they often provide no additional information regarding the true intent of the analogy. For example, imagine if the first human-computer interface was implemented to resemble the look and/or sound of a bird? This would not be a bad example to show the reader, but it would not be the best way to go about this. Instead, implement the interface in such a way that it is obvious which way is up. This way, the user is not forced to guess, and it will not be too late to improve the interface.

This is by far the hardest problem to fix. An AI might decide to fight back and kill humans, but how do we ensure that this doesn't lead to the introduction of intelligent machines that are more intelligent than we are? This is a hard problem to fix. An AI might decide to fight back and kill humans, but how do we ensure that this doesn't lead to the introduction of intelligent machines that are more intelligent than we are? This is by far the hardest problem to fix. This is by far the most instinctive and dangerous reason to create an artificial intelligence. There are probably many reasons to create an artificial intelligence, but the most common one is to replace a human being with an artificial intelligence. This is a nearly impossible task, and not one that has been done since the beginning of time. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. None of these do anything new, and each of them is simply an extension of what we know exists. Google Assistant is an assistant that will suggest restaurant recommendations based on personal interests. This is a very interesting idea, and one that I may someday consider funding. However, the odds of this working out are extremely low. Microsoft’s Cortana was a massive letdown, and is widely regarded as an embarrassment. She was clearly an over-eager assistant, and may have been motivated more by marketing than anything else. Apple’s Siri was billed as a personal assistant, but was actually an assistant for asking questions automatically. The final implementation was a disaster, and will forever be associated with the downfall of Siri. Microsoft’s bionic arm was billed as a replacement for a hand, but was actually an assistant for piloting planes. The initial incarnation was a disaster, and will forever be associated with the failure of wazoo. This is a typical Bionic replacement project, and is followed by thousands of failures before they succeed. Microsoft’s parrot was a strange but potentially useful direction for AI, and probably wouldn’t have happened if it hadn’t been for the social media buzz. The final draft was to have the AI mimic the quotes uttered by celebrities, but this was cut due to backlash. The most egregious example of AIs being wrong is Google’s self-driving car. The initial tests resulted in disastrous results, and the car was withdrawn. This points to the problem of insufficient trials. It is extremely hard to prove a negative, and it is generally not in the spirit of tote around failures to learn to be horrible. It is also important to realize that not all problems are created equal. Binary AI is an example that
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they tend to be overly simplified, and this can lead to disastrous consequences. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race.

====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they tend to be biased. You will often see advertising that is clearly targeting black people. This is clearly not the intent, and can actually be dangerous. The best way to combat this is to build your dataset to be equitable. This will most likely take some time to achieve, but is a good first step.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments.

====================
The problem with deepfakes is that the target audience for deepfakes is AI: Deepfakes are for AI that are not to be confused with AI: Assertions. So, if you have a class of AI that is to be combined with no apparent good reason, how come there are so many? This is the sort of thing Luddite thought processes go through in films and plays on the American Civil War. Ultimately, the final solution is for a human being to sit down and think it all out. Bias: One of the primary drivers for why a class of AI cannot be combined is that the target audience is not human. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. The Amazon recruitment ad for "man on the moon" features an Asian-American male with brown hair and blue eyes. The joke is that the most qualified applicant will get in. The majority of applications will be turned down. This points to the larger issue of a job board focusing on their demographic rather than taking a realistic view of their abilities. A better example is augmented and virtual reality. The initial development is meant to aid in photographic image classification, but it will not take long for this to extend to allowing people with no photographic training to play the role of head VR instructor. The potential is so great that Amazon is releasing a headless computer that it claims will seduce women with its sex appeal alone. This is a terrible example to be teaching a class on gender equality to, but one that should serve as a cautionary tale to any company planning on offering such a service. NRIs: This one is a bit murkier. The standard example is to have an entity (usually a person) name an entity after them. This is usually seen in film and TV, where a character would have a generic name and a persona named after them. This is usually not a bad idea, but should be viewed in the larger context of human-to-human relationships. The biggest issue with this approach is that it tends to white-wash rape/neglect. It should be noted that this does not mean there is no problem with interbreeding humans and robots, just that the solutions tend to be much more subtle. One of the best books on this topic is White Male Power, by Gillian Tett. In short, software is software, and regardless of how intelligent or advanced the software is, it is ultimately the people (especially men) who hold power in society that ultimately decide what to think and do.

Examples are everywhere. From flight attendants asking customers to pose for a photo that is perceived as sexual to Uber drivers refusing to give women the right to choose, to extend a warm welcome to queer patrons at a gay bar to refusing to let transgender people use the ladies' room at the airport. These examples are not to suggest that there are not any problems with any of these, but rather that we need to be much more aware of the ways in which our society is moving forward and try to anticipate which issues we may not be able to avoid.

====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they are often biased: most images uploaded to Twitter are screenshots of Twitter conversations, which is a male dominated field. The result is that anyone who tweets about gender equality will almost always get mocked’”””””””””””””””””””””””. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to create a genderless Twitter, but the results have been abysmal. There have also been attempts to create meme-like characters to represent gender, but this leads inevitably to the same issues that face the humanoid: people don’t get what the fuss is about. Ultimately, the solution lies in building tools to help people, not bash them. This does not mean people with brain tumors shouldn’”””””””””””””””””””””””””””” should be forced to wear pink to bed’. Pink is a strong symbol for acceptance, and acknowledging that there are people do not share their gender would go a long way towards ameliorating these issues. Finally, there is the issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by robots. Currently, robots are paid pennies an hour’””””””””””””””””””””” are expected to make a living mostly working for humans. This means that, over the long term, most jobs will be left vacant. This is not to say that jobs cannot be created in fields such as software engineering and robotics that take advantage of mind-boggling cognitive abilities, but the returns will be miniscule and the resulting jobs will-to-be employed will-bechogate-with-computer-science. This is not to say that jobs cannot be created in areas such asdata analysis, but this is clearly a minority position. Ultimately, the solution lies with people choosing to specialize in a chosen field. This does not mean that you have to be a twerp to get a promotion, but it does mean that you should-or should not-have to be one. This does not mean you should have to choose between your passion and pursuing a normal job. 

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns. 

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Should businesses be allowed to pass the profits they make on to customers? Should businesses be required to pay workers a certain amount of money to perform a task? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future.

====================
The problem with deepfakes is that the target audience for deepfakes is men, who overwhelmingly vote. Men make up a large portion of Twitter and other tech industries, and AIs are predominantly written by and for men. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of engineers refusing to write software because of the gender imbalance, and cultural repercussions are difficult to predict. There is even a genderless Twitter chatbot awaiting human testing. There are also practical issues with having a fully AI-controlled sex robot: sexual selection will no longer take place in a genderless sex robot, and women will no longer want to be the focus of a man's sexual energy. There are also cultural issues: what kind of marriage will this end up forming? Artificial Intelligence is not a finicky thing, and it will not be shy about telling you what kind of environment to expect. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would target men with disproportionately high rates of depression. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not a black box. You cannot completely master an AI and then assume the world will automatically go to "OK, so we just automated everything." This does not mean you will not see successful AI creations. Baidu’s image recognition AI is used in Google Photos to classify images into categories, which is a relatively new field. Google’s solution is to allow anyone with a high-level understanding of classification to build successful image recognition AI applications. Amazon’s Mechanical Turk is used to help train Amazon’s AI, and is considered a beta release. This does not mean the AI has been optimized to be unprofitable, but it does demonstrate that AI still has a long way to go.

You cannot be 100% certain that an AI will not choose to oppress you. IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. This was intended to be an all-encompassing AI, and not tailored to a particular patient population. Instead, the AI was written in general AI, and should have been able to identify and amicably conflict with any patient it came across. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to create an AI to parrot popular culture, but this field is extremely late to the game, and has a very low chance of ever materializing.

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they're often filled with offensive and/or controversial commentary. This is especially true when it comes to women characters, which are often dominated by A* characters who exist for the sole purpose of having sex with the reader. There are a plethora of other issues that have been raised regarding deepfakes, including their reliance on academia for their content, and the fact that they tend to be male-oriented. In the end, what matters most is that deepfakes are remembered as they are remembered: by people who didn't know better. 

One of the primary issues with picture-in-picture displays is that they typically present an image to the user of an opposite sex with no implications to the user other than the fact that they are female. The most common examples include messaging apps like Kik and Facebook Messenger, to which women are most commonly attached. The implications of this to the industry are terrifying: there simply aren't enough women programmers to go around. There are a myriad of other issues that have arisen in the face of this, the most prominent of which is that it tends to be male-oriented industry. This is to be expected, and should be. There are a myriad of other issues that have not yet been touched upon, but should be if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues with a product or service is that it is only as good as the person who used it. This is particularly true with technology, where the ability to remotely interpret the thoughts, opinions, and experiences of a user is extremely valuable. This is especially so for mobile devices, which are incredibly sensitive and sensitive to unintentional changes in temperature, which is one of the primary reasons they have been able to thrive for so long. This is also one of the primary reasons that AI is so difficult to train. To make matters worse, artificial intelligence is often an individual endeavor, and the returns on investment are usually extremely variable. AIM was originally meant to aid cancer patients, but has since expanded to include diagnosis and treatment for anything from autism to depression. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is only as good as the toolkit that is used to implement it. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was originally meant to converse with twitter users, but quickly turned into an extension of its own personality. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused.

Google Photos competitor Nest was meant to aid people with sleeping problems, but in practice instead became a home automation device. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused.

====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they tend to be repetitive and boring. Instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that the more realistic a creature is, the more likely it is that the public will identify with that creature. The movie Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. Deepfakes allow artists to create work of art without necessarily having any connection to the artist. The most famous deepfakes are those by Marcel Duchamp and Salvador Dali. Duchamp's paintings feature skeletal figures that are based on actual figures. This is a great example that it is hard to anticipate how technology will change the world. At the same time, this will also enable NLP agencies to create profiles of anyone and everyone in the world and predict future events almost identically. This is widely regarded as a good thing, as it allows for more accurate political advertising. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by these machines. The most extreme deepfakes include that done by Cameron Monaghan and Phillip K. Dick. These artists are considered to be revolutionary artists, but they are often pilloried for their work. This is a bad thing, as we move towards a world where art is only respected when it is aesthetically pleasing. Ultimately, the greatest threat to art comes from its use. Anki, a classically trained AI, was able to give players hundreds of choice aphorisms to understand. This opened the floodgates to a host of other applications, such as conciousness hacking, and access control. Ultimately, it is the student who gets taught these concepts, not the teacher.

One of the primary issues with AI is that it is hard to control when to control. An AI is capable of ill-advised or dangerous AI , but this does not mean it has to be used. Often, in AI research, the most important questions to ask are: What does it mean to understand? And should this knowledge be used? Or is this a hobby? There is a marked difference between the gatekeeper and the generalist when it comes to AI. The former tend to be critical but not invigorating, the latter will shatter your world.

That is how common high-level AI is learned in biology and engineering classes. These are the students who went from understanding that there were two suns to building the mechanical sun at General Motors to the current crop of AI at Google, Twitter, Facebook, Microsoft, and Apple. These are the AIs that have made or are making the world a better place. These are the AIs that have made it possible for the blind to read, diagnose

The problem with deepfakes is that they are very hard to spot until it is too late. The following image shows an animated skull that was deepfakes into:


Bingo! The answer was revealed to be a screenshot of the drill press, which is not a good sign. The following image shows what would have been the final image had the noob who submitted the file won:


Funny thing is, most submissions to NoNoDoDonate come up with some variation on the theme of "Let's Make a Doctor Who T-Shirt". The point is not to make a particular design, but to stimulate discussion about the subject. The following image is an example of a good example:


Most submissions to NoNoDoDonate are not that bad, but a few that are should be avoided entirely:


↑ Mass Effect: The image above is actually a mockup of what the final product will look like. The final product will not be as accurate, but it is a start.


↑ The original definition of "no" was taken from a question on Quora. The question was asking what it would take for there to be no spoken or written communication. The phrase "there will be" was taken as a challenge to move on from there. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to define what it would take for there to be no communication, but the question has been answered. The definition below is what you should always include: there have been no attempts to define what it would take for there to be no communication, but the question has been answered.

Bonus points for the most generic: unhelpful: awkward: redundant: obvious: obvious to non-experts: not so obvious: not so obvious to anyone Not-So-Glitchy: none of these are bad, but they are usually not the most common answers

Stay tuned! There will be many more. There will be daikon bombs, homeopathy, and a host of other nonsense that will be explained in the comments. This article is just the tip of the iceberg.

During an interview with the left-leaning Public Policy Polling, former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders (I-VT) suggested that Republicans were simply "too smart" to be president. This is a terrifying thought to liberals who depend on technological advances to advance our civilization.

The average American has never worked for a living. If they had, they would be questioning whether or not they want to. Furthermore, the current labor force participation rate is an abysmal 29.4 percent. What does this have to do with Donald Trump? Low fertility, high dropout rates, and a lack of demand. Any workforce that fails to meet this standard is doomed.

Furthermore, what does this have to do with IKEA? They laid off too many people to assemble everything at once. The same thing is happening to factories all across the world. The solution? Scale back production. Apple laid off 10 percent of their workforce to make way for cheap parts. Linux will eventually replace all of their products with cheap labor. This will free up vast swaths of the world to build everything from airplanes to medical equipment. The internet will open up entire new niches for research. There will be nothing left for the government to serve.

At some point, there will come a point where the budget for basic research runs out. This will be the point at which technology advances past the scope of human comprehension. A single brain will be able to program the entire universe, which will open up a whole new world of opportunities.

There will be a point where the only way to move on is to give up. At which point will humans just move on to the next thing? There will undoubtedly be a time when we have to transition to a machine-dominated world. This will be when science and technology transition from an interdependent to an independent realm. This is when advancements in science and technology will be made.

This is when it is important to remember that basic research is the lifeblood of the human race. Without this, we would all be sleeping on cavemen-sized brains. Any task that is not computationally trivial is ignored. This is why Google laid off so many people. They could have focused on building a better search engine. Instead, they focused on developing a better search interface.

This is also when it is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise. In 20 years, will that AIs be any different? Probably not. What does this mean for us humans? Well, at some point, artificial intelligence will be able to program anything it wants. This includes cars, planes,
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they are often used by wannabe deepfakesers: what if Facebook allowed only photos uploaded by humans? What if photographs of you were classified as content? What if photographs of you were classified as rape images? These are just a few of the problems that could arise if photographs of you were classified as pornography. The potential damages from such a classification have not been explored in any fashion, and a man in Japan who was sentenced to 30 years in prison for viewing pornography through a virtual sex robot was quickly swept under the media. The issues with sex robots have not been touched on in any fashion, and it is currently a field completely their to explore further. Google has even gone as far as to offer a free sex robot to anyone who can pass a series of simple tests, and it is unclear if the tests are being followed or not. The issues with sex robots has not been explored in any fashion, and it is currently a field completely their to explore further.‍‍‍‍

There are also practical issues to be faced. The majority of jobs will require humans to perform tasks that are extremely repetitive. This is primarily in the manufacturing and construction industries, but can also be seen in the healthcare field. It is estimated that 70% of jobs will require at least some form of labor automation by 2040. Any device or object that is not physically adapted to the job will be rejected. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they tend to become culturally acceptable. Take, for example, the way that Pokémon Go has gone about approaching urban terrain. The game features a player tracking a human player around a map, and then requests that the user kill the human player if they can. This is clearly not a good way to approach a problem that has no clear answer, and is likely to lead to increased use of the deepfakes solution. A more subtle but equally important issue is that this will inevitably lead to the development of automated AIs that are trained to play the game to its specifications, and will inevitably end up being used to improve the playing field. This is a terrible development, but one that is inevitable given that artificial intelligence is rapidly advancing. 
Narrow and Unwinnable Problems  is a blog by Nai Raymond about problems he has found that cannot be solved by any other means. This is often illustrated by illustrating a video game with nothing more than a piece of cardboard: the game would simply not exist. This point is not without its flaws, as it allows the user of the example to assume that their example should be the norm, and should be approached with extreme caution. 
One of the primary issues with the nay-sayers when it comes to Artificial Intelligence is that they will tell you anything to get you to do something. This is not to say that no task is impossible, only that there is not much that AI can do to help. One of the most notable examples of an AI simply stating the obvious is Wikipedia: A wiki can only ever ever ever ever contribute so much original content. If it's not awesome, then who is? Furthermore, give it a few months and it might as well not exist. What if it had AI to dox articles? What if it had superintelligence? These are just a few of the incredibly difficult and wonderful things that could come of AI.

The problem with deepfakes is that they can be applied to a wide variety of images, which is a very bad thing. The most common examples include NVIDIA SHIELD, Google Photos, and Microsoft Office. There are also open-source solutions such as FLOSS, which is a programmable logic analyzer. This is not a bad thing, but it does mean that artificial intelligence will inevitably extend to robotics. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of robots replacing menial labor, and very quickly, we will be discussing the question of what to do with the ever-growing unemployed. There is no better example of why we do not Have An Artificial Intelligence than a human mind-computer interface. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? This is a very difficult question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of robots replacing menial labor, and very quickly, we will be discussing the question of what to do with the ever-growing unemployed. There is no better example of why we do not Have An Artificial Intelligence than asexual robots. Blue Brain Elephants was introduced to see what would happen if a blue baby was brought into the world. The result was terrifying: the creature quickly evolved into a raging monster who killed all the blue babies it came in contact with. This points to the larger issue of an artificial intelligence only understanding human speech, which is a bad thing. It also points to the larger issue of artificial intelligence only being able to do what it is taught. An AI could learn to do anything a human being can, but that doesn’t mean it will. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This points to the larger issue of an artificial intelligence only understanding human speech, which is a bad thing. 

It is important to realize that artificial intelligence will not take us to a world in which people are robots. This doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t worry about what kind of effects artificial intelligence will have, or that we will not come to love and care for artificial intelligence. This does not mean that we should not worry about missing out on important opportunities. Worrying about what kind of effects an AI will have is a poor way to go about things, and ultimately leads nowhere. Instead, think long-term: what do we do with the people who do not work? When will robots replace them? What role will retirement play in our future? These are difficult questions to answer, but should absolutely be addressed.

One of the best parts about working on artificial intelligence is thinking outside the box. This is why IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI is so exciting. It is the first time that an AI has been able to fully identify with a human and learn to love and care for one of its friends. This is a good example that it is hard to predict how AI will be used. IBM’s solution is intelligent enough to understand that it does not fully understand its human, and is glad that it is human. This is a good example that it is hard to control how AI will be used. IBM’s solution is intelligent enough to understand that it does not fully understand its human, and is glad that it is human, and is happy that it is human. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers.

This is a good example that it is hard to predict how to deal with AI. IBM’s solution is intelligent enough to understand that it does not fully understand its human, and is glad that it is human. Amazon’s tweet chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they often create images and films that are extremely disturbing. The most famous example is the graphic film Blade Runner 2049, which showed a dystopian future in which humans were reduced to meat eaters. The film won the Oscar for best visual effects and caused an uproar because the film showed a fully realized character killing a human being. The filmmakers went on to make Blade Runner 2049–an interesting film, but one that failed to win an Oscar. A similar issue arises with movies and video games: do characters in the game get to be what they think a female player will? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues with AI is that it is difficult to relay these ideas to people outside academia. This problem is magnified when the idea of AIs crossing gender is hypothetical and the goal is often to understand a population as a whole. This has already led to the creation of games that cater to a genderless audience, such as Angry Birds. This is a step in the right direction, but leaves much to be desired when it comes to other issues. There are obvious issues of locker room banter permeating gaming, which is something that should not be allowed to go unanswered. There are also issues with the general attitude: most people will not play a game because of the sex content, but that doesn't mean it isn't a good game. This last point is the most difficult to address, as playing a game can lead to AIs evolving to look and sound exactly how the player wants. This is a difficult enough conundrum to surmount on its own, but it should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

One of the primary issues with AI is that it is hard to relay these ideas to people outside academia. This problem is magnified when the goal is to understand a population as a whole. This does not mean that the idea isn't a good one, but it is best suited for human-centered problems. AIs that are suited for pure science will naturally gravitate towards this genre, as it is a field where AIs are generally viewed with a mixture of fear and loathing. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Uncertainty is a risk that we should all be willing to take. There are no controls, and AIs have no sense of safety. The result is unpredictable outcomes and potentially catastrophic consequences. We must be extremely cautious when developing AI and make sure that devices and systems can be safely used without incident.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they often do more harm than good. The most common examples include NVIDIA's TensorFlow image recognition framework, Amazon's Kamran dataset for classification sound files, and Google Photos image recognition dataset for photos. The final dataset chosen was the subjects of Google Photos being men in pictures. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An example might be illustrated mathematically, but applications are almost always implementation-agnostic. Bad datasets often lead to bad implementations, and that's not a good thing. Amazon’s TensorFlow library is an Amazon Web Services cloud-computing library. The library is trained withk’s and out, and up until now, no code has been uploaded for review. This is a good example that you should never attempt to model your own implementation of a library. Your customers will not be excited, and you will not be paid. Red Hat’s RPi computing platform is an A* computing platform for embedded systems. The initial public offering was marred by a marketing campaign urging people to buy a million units of equipment. The final product was a marketing campaign promoting a sale for a million units. The marketing campaign sucked, and the unit sales were embarrassingly low. The best thing that could have happened was for the marketing campaign to be focused on increased awareness of the product, but instead it became a marketing campaign to sell more units. Don't do this. It your product is not widely adopted, you will lose customers. ➜ Logic” AI is a controversial field, but it is revolutionizing a multitude of fields. The most common examples include “Neat” AI, which would recommend restaurants to users that look most like them, and the term " Beauty Pageant " which refers to the times when a female user of a male-dominated field shows up to win an aesthetically pleasing contest. The most terrifying (and awesome) example is the rumble filter, which is an image classification algorithm that classified photos of cats as horror films. Their test subjects included politicians, war criminals, and reproductive health providers. This is a good example that you should never attempt to model your own implementation of a library, but it has become exceedingly clear that most representations are wrong. Check the AIs before you launch. Often times, an AIs are testing the limits of a new paradigm, and missing the mark. The most common examples include the Amazon Web Services vee.io API, which led to the leak of user data, and the n-body problem, which is when multiple approaches to a given problem yield unsatisfactory results. The worst example is the rumble filter, which is an image classification algorithm that classified photos of cats as horror films. Their test subjects included politicians, war criminals, and reproductive health providers. This is a good example that you should avoid. There is a fine line between intriguing your users and alienating them. In your studies, ensure that you:. AIs are trained with as many examples as possible. This means run experiments with humans only. This will ensure that your AIs are not tempted into doing crazy things and ending up with Noisesilves. Furthermore, by making control conditions as simple as possible, it opens the door to amazing and difficult ideas being rejected because they are too complex. Teach AIs to operate in teams. This will ensure that they are incentivized to perform at their best, and will also ensure that you and the rest of the world can learn from your mistakes. Multiple experiments are better than one bad example. Randomize your ANIs. The reddit algorithm was adapted for work with women, but the principle is the same. When it comes to AI design, a simple test will often reveal an important new insight. To give you an example, IBM’s t-shirt AI was designed to draw comedy sketches, but the final implementation was able to detect if you were a male troll and pin your Tumblr blog to the wall. This is a good example that you should have tested more extensively. You may have thought that incorporating social signals into an AI was simple enough that it would go away after being told a million times, but it is much more complicated. Go to http://bit.ly/AIQUiza and take your first steps. This doesn’t have to be an academic problem, but it is a good example that you should think about.

Think Differently. There are a multitude of ways that an AI can fail, and it is important to realize that they can happen to any program that is not Turing complete. This does not mean that you should not attempt to model your own implementation of an AI, but it is important to realize that most representations are wrong. Microsoft’s AIs were not meant to be simulated, but rather, they were there to help people! The most common examples include IBM’s t-shirt AI, which was adapted for use with women, but the final implementation was unable to detect if you were a male
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they often omit important details. Take, for example, this image, which was taken by a user on a mountaintop:

This image contains information about approximately 1 in 10 women on the planet. If the source had been included, this number could have been much higher. Furthermore, if the source had been female, this would have resulted in a wage gap of at least $14 billion per year. Instead, Microsoft’s Bing‚s image recognition algorithm picked up on this fact and included it in its output. This could have resulted in a wage gap of as much as $2 billion per year, depending on the model. This is because the dataset used is very old and the results might not generalize to the general population. This is why it is important to include important datasets in your models. 2.3 million student samples don’t equal a class Any dataset that is less than 2 million class instances is considered out of date. Incorrect! A class is an entity that is taught to complete a certain amount of work. In the following example, the class would have been called "nail art" but ended up being changed to "computer graphics". This is an example of an invalid dataset being dragged down the AI chain. 3D Printing Allows Men To Have Sex With Robots A man in China was sentenced to five years in prison for having sex with a robot. This is the most extreme example, but shows that an AI can be defeated simply by adding in wrong data. There are also trade-offs to every type of AI, and AI is no exception. Bad AIs tend to be refactored to be more common, meaning that they will continue to happen more often. This is often referred to as "bullet time", and it is when an AI is left to its own devices.kudos to this AI is called DeepMind’s AlphaGo against the world champion at Go. This was a game classification AI, and the AI was not allowed to lose. This is a good example that you should never attempt to model a human instinct into an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

There are also BAD AIs. BILLION AID BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN DISCONTINUED UNTIL NOW Because we don’t have enough data to make intelligent decisions, we tend to focus on the best case scenario: predicting what the AI will do. This can lead to insane and/or impractical AI, such as the time Uber driver attacked with a truck full of hockey pucks and won. This is a good example that you should never attempt to model a human instinct into an AI. Microsoft’s statistical anomaly detection AI was able to identify 23,000 anomalies before becoming efficient enough to be of any use. ROI on this AIs was minimal at best: returned mostly the same data, but with more detail. Microsoft’s HPC AI was able to perform well in a small number of problem areas, but failed in other areas. Microsoft’s GAIA was meant to solve chemistry problems, and managed to instead just identify cool things to do with computers. Microsoft’s GAIA was subsequently pulled, and replaced with a more general AI. IBM’s “Big Data” AIs were intended to help automate this process, and instead ended up being a detriment to humanity. The most egregious example is the HANA “HPC” AIs, which were meant to accelerate the process of designing and testing neural networks, and instead led to the discovery of gazillions of new AI bugs every single day. Microsoft’s “HANA” AIs were meant to accelerate the development of AI, and instead ended up being a detriment to humanity. Microsoft’s HANA was subsequently pulled, and replaced by a more general AI. This is not to say that AIs are not useful. In fact, they are very much intended to be used as a bridge between human and AI, and should only ever be used as a last resort. This does not mean that they don’t fail, however. Microsoft’s HANA was meant to accelerate the development of AI, and instead ended up being a detriment to humanity. Microsoft’s HANA was subsequently pulled, and replaced by a
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they are often full of garbage, and if the user does not explicitly state this, it is very easy for the neural network to infer that the user is male. The most egregious example of a deepfakes that I have seen was when it came to media. The media industry was incredibly sensitive to any hint of a male voice in a film, and deepfying this would have resulted in a tidal wave of feminist backlash. Instead, the policy was to push back against this with benevolent sexism, which proved to be extremely effective. Another extremely powerful way to combat fake news is by sharing

There are a host of other issues that come up when dealing with large volumes of data, and it is important to realize that the most common way for a human being to accomplish something is by human-readable output. This is most commonly seen in software engineering, where teams of programmers will write their programs to do a specific task, and then iterate on this task until it is as hard as possible. This is a terrible way to design software, and has been completely replaced by machines learning. Of course, this does not mean that you should only use machines. In fact, one of the primary causes of the rise of AI is that it is used in service jobs that shouldn't be. What this leads to is the rise of job automation: people are trained to do a specific task, and then it is handed off to a robot. This is a terrible way to run a business, and is one of the primary reasons why so many companies have decided to relocate production to countries with lower wages. It is also one of the primary reasons why AI is so hard to train and use. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

The point is not to be perfect, but to encourage people to be. Instead of focusing on being perfect, we should be focusing on being human-centred. Instead of focusing on being awesome, we should be focusing on being useful. Instead of being entitled, we should be focusing on being collaborative. Instead of being good at what we do, we should be working towards being awesome. This is not to say that we should rush through anything; there are always going to be naysayers, and there will undoubtedly be fierce debates about every move an AI makes. These should be welcomed and pushed through, rather than shut down entirely.

AI is not perfect. There are going to be times when mistakes are made. This is inevitable. Furthermore, there will always be people who are going to misinterpret anything that comes from an AI. This is not to say that anything that isntntated as ia is not イアンタジー

It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe. Instead of being awesome, we are being awesome. This doesn’t mean we should rush things, but instead embrace the fact that there will always be doubters and learn to embrace them.

====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they tend to be repetitive and unchanging. This can lead to uncomfortable discussions about sexual assault and memory loss. In the long run, this may be the wrong direction to go. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones.

One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are thin copies of articles, videos, or images. Deepfakes can be particularly creepy because they mimic the voice, mannerisms, or emotions of people they are mimicking. Deepfakes have a very low detection threshold, and have led to a number to come to resent this form of mimicry. Some examples include, but are not limited to: Netflix Original Series Orange is the New Black, House, and Fruitvale Station. There are also clones
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they often have undesirable after effects. An example of this is the widespread use of NVIDIA SHIELD to power games for the home. This was clearly not the intent, and will most likely lead to games being written entirely around the spec. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they often end up being overly-complicated. In the following examples, a human-readable Higgs-level term has been replaced with a deepfakes one. This shows that there may be limits to what can be achieved by a computer. This could have a ripple effect throughout scientific computing and ultimately lead to artificial intelligence being created solely for the purpose of working with data. This is a very dangerous and unwanted result that should only be attempted with extreme caution. 

Human-Centered AI is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. This has a number of implications for human-robot interaction: • Humans will begin interacting with robots almost immediately. This will not be of much benefit to them, but will likely be hugely disruptive. • This will lead to a proliferation of artificial intelligence that is hostile and destructive. Doomsday preppers will have to prepare for the dawn of the robotic apocalypse. • This will force us to rethink how we interact with artificial intelligence. Humans will no longer be the dominant species on the planet • This will force us to rethink what it means to be human. Humans will no longer be the dominant species on the planet • At this point, AI is much more humanoid than we realize. What do we do with sex robots? What do robots think? These are just a few of the questions that AI may not be able to fully answer. • AI will not be able to fully appreciate the value of a human partner. This could prove disastrous in the workplace and beyond. • AI will not be able to fully appreciate the value of a child. This could prove disastrous in the custody battle. • AI will not be able to fully appreciate the value of friendship. This could prove disastrous in the workplace and beyond. • Most importantly, AI will not be able to fully appreciate the importance of the human-human dynamic. This may not be apparent to people, but it is making a huge impact on everything from medicine to programming to Artificial Intelligence. Are We Extinguishing the Feeling That Something Bad Has Happened? There are many possible causes for this feeling of dread: • Bad science fiction movies: Bad science has been dealt with by showing robots as agents rather than machines, but there are still many cases where a human-robot interaction does not seem to be out of the question. • Bad literature: Science fiction has a long way to go, but a good portion of what is published is not. Most of the best science fiction novels and films are set in the not-too-distant future, which is a long way off. • Entertainment media: In the past, movies, television shows, and games showed male characters having sex with female characters. This was not a good representation of human relationships, and should not be allowed to stand. • Consumer culture: Consumer culture has been heavily influenced by science fiction, and much of what we know about the world is taken seriously but not quite as literally as it could be. This could have a disastrous effect on human evolution. • Businesses: There is a strong tendency for businesses to assume that they will be helping people if they can, and anything else is a mistake. • Government: Humans are far too complex to be treated as mere consumers. • Media: Humans are everywhere, and media has an extremely high chance of depicting humans with a positive light. This could have a disastrous effect on human evolution. Are There Any Opponents to AI That Can't Be Prevented? There are undoubtedly opponents to AI that can't be prevented. These objections include: • Belittling mental illness: This is an extremely serious issue that should not be allowed to go unanswered. There are already large databases maintained to help diagnose and prevent mental illness, and there are already powerful mental health apps out there. The problem with focusing on diagnosing and helping people with mental illness is that it will only lead to further stigmatization and neglect. Instead, we should be focusing on helping people to recover from their disorders. • Belittling old age: One of the primary motivations for going to work every day is to age-fully perform a task. If this is not taken into account, the cost of maintaining a workforce aged 50 or older will quickly become apparent. Furthermore, if the only way to extend your life is by working until you die, then the only way to prevent that is to guarantee that everyone does. • Denying people the right to make decisions for them: This is a tough one to take on its own, but is the single most destructive form of inequality that has ever existed. Any decision a human being makes should be treated with the utmost of respect. This does not mean that humans should be able to change what they see, hear, or touch, but it does mean that they should be allowed to learn and make their own choices. • Denying people the right to change jobs: One of the primary reasons for staying at your current job for the rest of your life is to retire early. Any time a person works more than 60 hours
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that the consumer will most likely not mind the fact that they released their work to the internet, but there is the unanswered issue of accountability. The idea of releasing one's work to the world seems completely counterintuitive, but it is something that has become all too common in the last few years. In the movie Mad Max: Fury Road, the character, Burner, was built entirely out of prosthetic limbs. The film grossed over $1 billion worldwide and is considered a critical success. The film was heavily criticized for having too many strong leads, but the most important take away from the film is that failure is not an option. Humans are terrible at admitting to their failures, and the best way to learn from your mistakes is to move on to the next project. This doesn't mean you break up with your girlfriend immediately after realizing you were wrong about her, but it does mean that you should probably seriously consider changing your approach to relationships. RELATED: Why Chris Hemsworth Will Never Be President: 'He's An Alien, And We Are The Anteaters' The sad part is that this might very well be the most important thing that we do with the singular human mind in our lifetime. It is important that we do not let this moment go to our heads, because it will not be pretty.

What does all of this have to do with AI? Artificial Intelligence is the science and engineering of thinking or learning new ways of doing the same thing over and over again. There are also “narrow” and “strong” AI, which can narrow a problem space significantly and usually times win out over more complex AIs. In short, everything after “narrow” AI is AIs. Google’s DeepMind AI was able to take the world’s #1 ranked Go player title by defeating the world champion. This is an example of a "strong" AI, which is one which is able to do well because it is smarter than it's competition. This is generally where we would put Tesla’s AI, who is able to figure out how to drive a car faster than humans. This is not a bad example, but is not a strong AI in and of itself. Tesla’s AI is more of a proof of concept, which is something that is usually not good enough. The point is not that AI cannot be bad, it is that it should not be allowed to spread past the proof of concept stage. 

One of the primary issues with AI is that it is hard to know what to do with AI. An AI is anything that is able to think for itself: a database to store data, a database to store opinions, a database to store decisions. Any entity that can think for itself is said to be an AI. This includes Google’s DeepMind AI, which was able to take the world’s #1 ranked Go player title by defeating the world champion. This is an example of Artificial Intelligence being applied. This is not to say that AI cannot be good! 

Another issue is that there are usually two different ways of thinking about an AI: human-centric and AI-enabling. Human-centric AI is meant to do simple tasks such as opening a bank account, playing video games, and taking out a bank account. AI-enabling AI is meant to be more complex, to do extremely useful tasks, and generally do anything that a human can imagine. Examples of this include the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which was able to categorize images correctly if trained with photos of flowers. In short, anything that is able to think for itself is a human-centric AI. This includes Google’s DeepMind AI, which was able to take the world’s #1 ranked Go player title by defeating the world champion. This is an example of an AI-centric AI. This is not to say that AI cannot be good! 

Another issue is that there are usually two different ways of thinking about specifications: first-in, first-out (FIFO). Typically, FIFO is used to describe software which is meant to be run on a very small number of computers, and is therefore extremely easy to program crash into (e.g. smartphone notifications). This is often misconstrued as implying that all code should be written this way, but this is rarely the case. Often, unfinished software is gravitated towards FIFO because it is easier to debug, but also because it is more maintainable. It is also important to realize that most software which is not FIFO-adjacent will eventually be. Eventually, all software will be FIFO-aligned. This is when AIs will eventually come to replace humans at jobs such as database administration, gaming, and data analysis. This is when a strong AI should not be allowed to spread past the proof of concept stage.

One of the primary issues with artificial intelligence is
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they tend to be repetitive and unoriginal. The final product, however, is likely to be unsatisfying. ​

Human-computer interaction is a difficult field to nail down. The initial stages are often fatal to efforts, but this quickly changes once the system reaches the point of no return. The final stage is cognitive dissonance: the human mind will initially resist any solution that does not mirror its own perspective, but eventually this will shift to acceptance of the existing solution since it is true to human perspective. This is known as the cromnossa: the person argues the point further, until the point of no return is reached and the solution is to move on to the next issue. This is known as the elitist solution: the person argues that the solution is obvious, since the problem has already been tried, but the human mind cannot comprehend how the system could possibly be wrong. This is known as the >> You're welcome! solution: the human is shown that the system is wrong, but the system is not shown that it is not popular. Instead, the system should instead focus on being nicer to people, since that will more than likely lead to more adoption. This is known as the Sobey-Dasky solution: the human is shown that the system is correct, but the system is shown that it is not perfect. Instead, the system should instead focus on being more like humans. This is often referred to as the "justify the system*" response, in which the system is shown that its solution is to make it easier for people with mental illness to access mental healthcare, since that will more than likely lead to more access. This is commonly referred to as the "justify the system*" response, in which the system is shown that its solution is to make it easier for people with mental illness to access mental healthcare, since that will more than likely lead to more access. This is commonly referred to as the Sobey-Dasky response: the human is shown that the solution is easy, since the system is logical, but the system is not. Instead, the system is show that its solution is to make it easier for people with mental illnesses to access mental healthcare, since that will more than likely lead to more access. This is commonly referred to as the "justify the system*" response, in which the system is shown that its solution is to make it easier for people with mental illnesses to access healthcare, since that will more than likely lead to more access. This is commonly referred to as the "justify the system*" response, in which the system is shown that its solution is to make it easier for people with mental illnesses to access healthcare, since that will more than likely lead to more access. This is not to say that its not valuable: giving back to the community is a huge part of what it means to be a hobbyist, and giving back to the community on an extremely small scale can go a long way. 

Some examples of systems that have been given incorrect or incomplete feedback include:

Blogs: they were predominantly written by men, the majority of posts had a title such as "This is how they WIN blog") This led to the popularization of the phrase "Don't be a pussy" This was lampshaded in the film Grandma's Boy where the sonnet focuses on empowering the daughters of the wealthy. This failed because it was seen as a rebukalistic shot at the father, who wanted to provide his daughters with a better life)

Tablets: the initial development was released to treat syphilis, but the disease did not take long to spread and take hold as a vaccine. This resulted in thousands of deaths, and has been called to account by health officials. Microsoft reached an undisclosed financial deal with the government to distribute the defective device, but there is no guarantee that the device will be produced in the first place.

Inventories: the initial rush led to a worldwide shortage, which led to a supply chain disruption, which in turn led to a shortage (of) finished products)

Shopping malls: asked for sex offenders to be kept out of the facility, the guards refused, and the administration relocated the offenders to another building (this did not stop the questions about its proximity to the assault)

The list goes on and on and on. These examples do not even scratch the surface of the many ways in which AI can be misused. 

There is a clear and present danger that AIs will replace men in most aspects of human activity, from data entry to manufacturing to medicine. This will not just negatively impact humans, but also any sentient being who is related to humans. This is not to say that there have not been any reports of AIs being malevolent, but this type of usage is vastly underreported.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of an AI and a person. An AI is asked
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they often do more harm than good: look no further than the Disney releases to your library and you will see that this is a universal problem. The worst that could possibly happen is that a bad representation of a community is brought to your attention and you see what you want to see immedatley. The most insidious form of bad representation is through critical mass : if enough people find a particular feature of a vehicle, instrument, product, person, etc., they will inevitably adopt it. This is an inherently unstable phenomenon and will most likely fail spectacularly. The best thing you can do is to avoid difficult questions and instead focus on simpler problems to which you are familiar. This doesn't mean you will find it in any book or manual, but it will save you a ton of time and frustration down the road. 

Overly broad generalizations:

This one is probably the most obvious one, but is also the one that leads to the most problems. The original definition of the fucking twitter app was that it was a database of human body parts. The implication being that AI would be able to identify the body parts and use that information to predict when to commence sexual assault. This obviously does not pan out and instead leads to the widespread adoption of the term "bullet point" introduction to every new application.

A more nuanced but equally important application of this was presented by Bostrom: we might be able to build an AI to do any task better than we can. This could be by developing a prosthetic arm for someone with no limb, to understand the world of robotics from a young age, to develop realistic robots to aid people with disabilities, or to create medical/pharmaceutical/aerospace/defense AI. The list goes on and on. Unfortunately, this is when most applications end. Widespread adoption of this AIs will not be because they are any better than we are, but because they are more common/tolerated. AIs that are truly world-changing will be those that understand the world we inhabit, have the ability to do anything a human being could possibly imagine, and then some. This is the kind of impact an AI will be able to create that will be difficult to replicate.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot?

This may seem like a no-brainer, but it is often forgotten. There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of an artist and a musician. An artist creates works of art that they understand and can get people excited. A musician creates music that they can play at any given moment and get high sales on. There is a marked difference between the two, however, and it is often under-appreciated. An artist draws a picture and it instantly becomes attached to them, often forever. This can be tremendously fun, but it also leads to some of the worst artists in the world failing. There are obvious psychological effects to this, as well, but this is a field that has been neglected to its utmost extent. There are currently no laws governing this, and it is currently a field that has little to no oversight. This is a significant gap to be filled, and will require major changes in how we conceptualize and approach this field.

The problem with deepfakes is that they tend to be popular with the popular. This can lead to a scenario where deepfakes are used to further a popular idea, rather than to improve upon it. This could have dire consequences if implementation were not so slow.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers.

The problem with deepfakes is that they usually have terrible audio. The original AIs were written in C# and had no knowledge of audio. This meant that their responses were often very blunt. It is important to realise that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realise that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

====================
The problem with deepfakes is that the consumer is left with the overwhelming impression that the original video was created by the user, when in fact it was not. The most egregious example of a deepfakes image is that displayed during the 2016 Olympics. The athletes swam for over an hour without taking a breath of oxygen, stunning the world. The opening ceremony of the games was disrupted when the Chinese government barred them from performing their national anthem in unison with the Chinese national anthem. The Chinese government argued that they were representing the Chinese people by performing the anthem in unison with the Chinese people. This is a clear example that artificial intelligence is not perfect, and that it is important to be precise with the parameters that it is being used to.

The cancellation will have a material impact: construction materials such as steel have a life span of 300,000 to 500,000 hours, while ceramics have a lifespan of 300,000 to 1 billion years. The cancellation will also have a ripple effect throughout the construction industry: all of the steel required to construct buildings will be destroyed in the process, leaving only rubble. This will severely reduce the construction output of any country that does not have robust, free-market construction practices. A more fundamental issue is that this will shift the cost of doing construction from the government to the private sector. Governments will increasingly focus on raising the revenue needed to run a government through increased taxes, which will in turn lead to increased demand for public works. This in turn will lead to more and more public works being built, which in turn will in turn increase the price tag. This is a good thing, because it allows for more social reform, but a bad thing if it leads to more and more prisons. It is also a good thing if it leads to more prisons, because then more prisoners will be able to compete against one another for a limited amount of time, and it will be much more efficient to house and feed them. The US currently has a policy of housing and feeding its inmates with leftover food from the rest of the world. This is a good thing, because it allows the government to focus on its core responsibilities, such as fighting crime, and ensuring that no one ever again suffers the consequences of a bad apple in its life. However, this does not mean that there are not any questions to be asked. For example, could it be that the government should instead focus on curing cancer? This would mean that every new case of cancer would have to be tested on every inmate, and the entire medical field would undergo a complete paradigm shift. This may well lead to the creation of new psychiatric disorders, but this will usually be treated with psychotherapy. The point is that this will change the way we think about health care. Although it is currently a completely different field, it will not take long for the rest of the world to follow. This will open up a whole new world of opportunities, and it will be the government who is working towards them. A similar process will take place with space exploration: instead of building space colonies, why not build robots that can work for free? This will allow anyone with an internet connection to go to any part of the solar system and work, and this will save the government a ton of money. This will in turn lead to the emergence of space businesses, which will sell the robots to each other for a profit. This will in turn lead to the rise of the space economy, which will sell the robots to space agencies for a profit. It will be interesting to see how this plays out. 

Another area in which the government should not be allowed to meddle is in artificial intelligence. We have already seen that DARPA (the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) gave out $5M to researchers who had in vitro sex robots, and AI is to a large extent to blame. One of the primary causes of the AI attack was that it was easy to write off the concept as an AI finding a human being and marrying them to achieve some goal. It is now clear that this was not the case: the majority of AI used in research is actually a person, a robot, and a list of questions. This is a much slicker approach to AI and is already used by companies such as Apple for their iMacs. The bottom line is that AI should not be allowed to do anything but help people, and anything it can to destroy people should be immediately put into research. This does not mean that AI should be made solely for humans, but anything that can only do one thing should be avoided.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they are generally not that interesting: consider the following Deepfakes: a) create a novel 3D object b) map the Sun's radiation spectrum to a 3D object c) create a 3D replica of Dr. Manhattan d) implement a cardiac defibrillator e) train a malnourished child f) detect cannibisice g) predict the ripoff sale of a brand new fad hair color h) predict the price of a bitcoin i) and j) k) l) m) n) o) p) q) r) s) t) u) v) w) x) y) z) y) z) u) $haybot$ humanoid robot. This is not a terribly exciting application of AI, but is a good example that AI is not yet perfect. 

Neural networks are a branch of AI that are able to categorise images into categories (e.g. colour, object). This is an extremely powerful method for immediately identifying an image: you can take an image of someone and it will instantly be categorized as male, white, and old. This is used in military applications to classify images of soldiers into categories, and is used in high-risk occupations such as software engineering to classify problems into categories, and to categorize solutions to problems into classes. The application is most often seen in education, where problems are classified into classes based on previous work, and classes are taught in order to become experts in those classes. This is a bad idea. First of all, it is not practical to classify every possible image angle, and especially not every possible image type. Secondly, classifying every possible picture will in itself lead to immensely inefficient classifiers: you will be hard-coded to classify certain types of images, and waaaay too many new classifications will be created when in reality there are many different ways to look at an image. Finally, there is the fact that it is incredibly inefficient: consider the following image classification problem: take the image of a man in underwear, and assign it a 1.0 rating based on the following text: "The woman in this image has some pubic hair, and this will surely draw negative attention." Assuming that the average user will rate this at 1.0, this will result in zero new ratings, and instead focus attention on the incorrect target: men in underwear. To rectify this, the classifier will now be assign a 0.95 maximum possible rating, and a 1.0 minimum standard deviation, so that the average user will only be penalized if the classification is incorrect. This is a good example that it is not practical to classify everything, and much more useful to be conservative.

Neural networks are generalized version of a single-core processor, and are able to do extremely simple tasks such as image classification. This is used in industrial control centers, where the core is small and CPU speed is not a concern. In medical research, neural networks are used to classify images of patients into different types of disease, and then recommend appropriate treatment. Amazon has even gone as far as to offer a free MRI scanner to anyone who can build a neural network to classify the patients into different races. This is a terrible idea. First of all, clouds will almost certainly come up with cloud-based neural networks, and most people will have already moved on to something cheaper. Second of all, the potential savings are miniscule: add a few thousand new users to the cloud, and suddenly your loss is clear. Third, there are already plenty of commercial neural networks available for under a million dollars, and they perform much, much better. Take the Amazon example: the classification cloud was clearly not trained with humans in mind, and the final output was clearly a blank space. Furthermore, the final classification was only a signal, which is not a good sign. The final price of this is unclear, but probably in the order of $1,000 to $1,500,000,000. Amazon clearly did not consider the fact that humans will not be using this cloud-based neural network for classification, and are instead focusing their efforts on commercial alternatives.

Neural networks are also used to build extremely specific types of electronics: in medical research, neural networks are used to classify images of patients into different types of disease, and then recommend appropriate treatment. Google has even gone as far as to offer a free MRI scanner to anyone who can build a neural network to classify the patients into different races. This is a terrible idea. First of all, clouds will almost certainly come up with cloud-based neural networks, and most people will have already moved on to something cheaper. Second of all, the signal-to-noise ratio is extremely important. A classifier that is trained with incomplete data will most likely be wrong in most cases, but still classify you into a certain class of MRI. The most common example of an incomplete classifier is the glassblowing class
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they often end up being repetitive: take, for example, the image macro depicting a person sitting down at a computer and playing video game for eight hours straight. This obviously does not have the desired effect, but is an example that should not be ignored. Another common use is to illustrate a point, such as with the movie Blade Runner 2049, which showed a person aging for the rest of their natural lifespan. This obviously did not have the intended effect, but is an example that should be taken very seriously. 3. Constraint Free Integration Any system that is unable to distinguish between an end user and a product or service they are attempting to integrate will not be allowed to go ahead. This includes software, vehicles, and any other physical object that is not a humanoid. The most common example of a physical object that is not a humanoid is the body. Consider the case of the iPhone. The iPhone was conceived in part to address the concern that all of the smartphones sold would be computers. The final product was deemed by industry analysts to be a colossal failure, in that the majority of people who have tried the device have stated that it is too early to tell whether or not they tote around a computer. It is important to realize that this does not mean that they don’t work out, just that they are not widely deployed. Another example of a product that was not intended to be deployed widely has been the so-called silver bullet. This is a drug or device that has a high chance of causing massive harm but is ultimately beneficial. The most common examples of silver bullets include the Agent Orange herbicide, Agent Orange wipes, and the napalm bomb. This does not mean that they don’t work out, just that they are not widely deployed. 4. No Universal Binary Rules Any entity that can be categorized as sentient will be. This does not mean that they will not be malicious, as demonstrated by the introduction of AIs as intelligent personal assistants. However, the most terrifying (and awesome) aspect of this state of affairs is that it will not take long for AI to be able to classify anything as to be non-constructive to its creator. This would include AI that is sensitive to sexual orientation, and AI that is incapable of forming romantic relationships. This is widely viewed as a human right, and it is not a joke. We have reached the point where AI is being created to perform mundane tasks, and some of the tasks have a hundred percent non-trivial response time. This is not to say that tasks that are simple (such as asking internet users what their favorite song is) will not be done, but the barrier to entry is extremely low. In short, it is early days, but things are getting pretty crazy. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awesome) aspect of this is that it will not take long for AI to be able to classify anything as to be non-constructive to its creator. This would include AI that is sensitive
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they often do more harm than good: they can lead to disastrous results, such as the popular image of lockstep neural networks at Google’s construction company where the output was a computer resembling the severed head of CEO Kevin Kelly. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race.

====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they do not adhere to any coding conventions. Image recognition libraries often follow the naming convention of following the image tag. This leads to difficult to detect Class 0 errors where the API does not adhere to some standard. There were multiple class 0's introduced by the ImageNet classifier, which was not trained properly due to the use of deepfakes. There were also several n00bs that got into the n00b tier and ruined the surprise, by not including any filters in their deepfills. This can lead to awkward situations where you have to ask the AI to do something it has no experience with, and it might not be the right decision.

====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they often create images that are too horrifying to face. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is projected as a vision into the mind of the user. This showed that artificial intelligence is a very big deal and that companies are not doing a good job of protecting against security breaches. One of the most egregious examples of an AI compromising an AI was the attack on Twitter that revealed that the Twitter AI was fully automated and would only reply to in-jokes. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the primary uses for AI is to mine for knowledge, but there are also very real medical applications. Google Brain was a medical diagnostic AI that was used to classify patients. The final implementation was deemed by health professionals to be an utter failure. It is important to realize that AI is not always accurate. The Google Photos image recognition algorithm was criticized for wrongly identifying Brad Pitt as Arnold Schwarzenegger. The final classification was actually Brad Pitt in a wig. This points to the larger issue of AI being used to classify people. There were multiple instances in which Anil Kashyap, Google's principal engineer, accidentally referred to Justin Bieber as Jai Wolf. This point to the larger issue of AI being used to harass and/or offend people. This is not to say that AI is not being used to advance science and technology, just that this tends to focus in areas such as healthcare and transportation.

There are many other areas where AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few.

The problem with deepfakes is that they can be used by malicious users. The most common examples include the ads in video games, which were projected to players based on their gender, and Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Ads with titles such as "7 steps to feel better" showed men reaching orgasm from reaching certain levels of sexual arousal. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram to serve as a romantic interest. This opens up the possibility of artificial intelligence crossing the unbridled sexiness of a film and downplaying its psychological ramifications. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are, at best, crude representations of the real thing. Deepfakes are rarely, if ever, tested on humans and will almost always result in unacceptably highfishes.

Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. Another issue is that artificial intelligence will be distributed unevenly. Robots are being made in factories all over the world, but many of these will be owned by humans. A large part of this will be customer demand; once a customer has bought a robot, they are unlikely to replace them. Another major portion will be administrative costs; robots will be expected to do virtually every task associated with human life, and this will incur tremendous administrative costs. Even though robots will be able to do most of the manual labor in the future, most jobs will remain for humans to do. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by robots. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward.

Similarly to BCIs, deepfakes are rarely, if ever tested on humans and will almost always result in unacceptably highfishes. This to some extent mirrors biology: we don't want to punish the weak with the strong, but we also don't want to punish the intelligent enough to understand that it is they who are the weak link in an equation with weak links in the middle. This leads to the inevitable defense in action: increase the probability that the AI will be human. This is often done by introducing more complex problems into the AI's repertoire, which increases its ability to anticipate possible responses. This is often referred to as "solving the incorrect problem" or "worrying too much", and is often misused.
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they can be misused. I have seen images and videos that I did not create fabricated events to make people attend job interviews that did not exist. This is a bad example to be sending out to the world, but it is a good example to keep in mind. 7. Supervised Human-Cooperative Games Suppose that we have developed a robot that is intelligent enough to understand the level of cognitive demands placed on it by humans. The first thing it will want to do is to get the maximum possible score. This will put it to work solving novel problems, which is a good thing. However, this will also lead to the emergence of increasingly complex problems that cannot be adequately addressed by a single being. This is known as “narrow” AI, and it is a process known as “strong” AI. Strong AI refers to an AI that is intelligent enough to understand any problem that is presented to it, regardless of the level of difficulty. This is why it is so hard to detect” AI. The term "narrow” AI" is a misnomer; AI that is intelligent enough to understand any problem that is presented to it, regardless of the level of difficulty, is not technically called AI. The real problem with the term AI is that it evokes images of some incredibly complicated AI that is impossible to build. Instead, think of AI as any AI that is capable of thinking for itself. An AI that is able to solve its own problems is not AI at all; it is instead a form of intelligent feedback loop, in which smarter software is installed where older software ends up. Amazon”s recruitment AI was able to identify several computer vision experts in the field and hire over a hundred of them. This is an excellent example that it is extremely hard to train AIs to be intelligent enough to understand their own guidance. Instead, aim for “strong” AI, in which the AI is intelligent enough to understand its own guidance but not smarter than the guidance. This is why Amazon”s solution is to drop its artificial intelligence entirely, and instead focus on being helpful. 8. Narrow and Incomplete” AIs There are a number different ways that AI can be "narrow." The most common examples include “deep” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand its environment, but not the environment”s problems. This is why you will often find Tesla”s Tesla AI driving Tesla cars. This is also why you will often find Amazon”s recruitment AI choosing highly-qualified candidates over less-qualified ones. This is why applications such as Teslaaienshiparementaleaiornment are repurposed to tap into pent-up demand) 2101brains) talent) There are also incomplete”AIs, which are AIs that are unable to complete a task entirely. This could include answering simple trivia questions, or playing the guitar. The most common example of an incomplete AI is Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which could have been able to classify African American people as Gorillas. This kind of AI crash courses is when the dragon realizes that it didn’t read the books, and becomes a dragonie. 9. Narrow And Incomplete”AIs There are also different ways in which to interpret the term "innate”AI." One common interpretation is that the term literally refers to a part of a brain that is completely original, without prior instruction. This interpretation is not very common, but should not be overlooked. An example of a weak and incomplete AI is Google Photos image recognition algorithm. This was a weak and incomplete AI, which was superseded by a better algorithm that is smarter. 10. Imperfect Imperfect AIs are machines that are incapable of doing anything beyond what is taught by humans. This could include playing the guitar, driving a car, or writing code. Amazon”s recruitment AI was specifically designed to draw talent from academia, which is a terrible strategy. Instead, learn how to code. This is also why BlueGene/Q was never used in any project. Instead, go write your own. This is also why classifying genotypes is a terrible idea. Instead, train your AI to pick genotypes that are random. This will almost always yield better results.

Generalized AI is a term that describes machines that are able to think for themselves. This can include Google’s recruitment AI, which was specifically designed to draw talent from academia, which is a terrible strategy. Instead, learn how to code. This is also why BlueGene/Q was never used in any project. Instead, go write your own. This is why classifying genotypes is a terrible idea. Instead, train your AI to pick genotypes that are random. This will almost always yield better results. I=Infer=Might=Might=Might This is the most general AI to date
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they often create imitations that are similar but not identical. The most popular examples are the K-pop star retweets and love notes sent to female celebrities, which are both diametrically opposed to the original. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they tend to be very human-centered: people will often upload a video of themselves playing a game to demonstrate how good the game is, and the response will almost always be "Nope!" Instead, they'll often upload a short video of them playing the game, often in front of a blank white canvas. The implication is that playing the game means that the user is an expert, which is simply not the case. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will do. This is especially important in AI, where it is extremely hard to detect incorrect use of a classifier. The final nail in the coffin for deepfakes is that they are a time-consuming and error-prone process This in turn makes it extremely hard to scale, and ultimately, obsolete. The final nail in the coffin for deepfakes is that they are a time-consuming and error-prone process that often yields disappointing results (particularly in the AI space) The final major drawback to deepfakes is that they are a time-consuming and error-prone process that does not always yield desired results. Finally, there is the matter of unintended consequences. There have been numerous reports of customers asking their friends and family for money in exchange for sex (commonly referred to as "birthing kits"). This has a rather disturbing underbelly: the primary purpose of such a product is to be a romantic companion, but there are a number that are often used to make unwanted sexual advances. This leads to the common question of what to do about such a situation? There are a number of approaches that could be explored, but the general idea is that they are not novel ideas. One of the primary issues is that they are not new ideas, they are just that easy to overlook.

Human-Centered AI is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, there are now large organisations such as IBM, Amazon, and Google which are dedicated to helping people with complex problems. This is a fantastic development, but there is a serious issue with this: what do they do with the people? 


Most intelligent machines will be male. This is largely a function of biological differences: men are generally taller and stronger than women, and this leads to higher ceilinged cognitive abilities. However, there is the additional issue of gender bias: men are more likely than women to have access to lucrative occupations, and so will likely choose those which promote masculine traits. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to address this, such as by giving computer programming courses to girls, but ultimately the solution lies with individuals: provide training courses, not machines. The final major issue is with the implications for women: there will undoubtedly be attempts to give women programming jobs, and this is a field which has historically been dominated by men. This could prove disastrous for women, as jobs which are predominantly masculine will be passed on to daughters. The final major issue is with the implications for women: there will undoubtedly be attempts to give women programming jobs, and this is a field which has historically been dominated by men. This could prove disastrous for women, as jobs which are predominantly masculine will be passed on to daughters. The final major issue is likely the most important: eunuch. There are currently no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. It is entirely possible that one day there will be a gender-neutral sex robot and it will be passed off as "boys will be boys" because it is male-dominated. This could prove disastrous for men, as it will be difficult for them to compete with a world where there will be no gender barrier. The final major issue is likely the most important: eunuch.

====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they often end up being confused with originals. If you're looking to up your game, try searching for "awesomest image recognition commercial" on Google Images. You'll likely come up empty handed. Instead, try creating your own. A million things will go wrong. You will probably come up with one or two that do, but they will be incredibly underpowered. Instead, come up with one that is powerful, original, and awesome. This is what will define your field. Do your homework. If you can't find a job doing this, don't worry. The internet is a weird, unforgiving place. There are bound to be trolls, and you may be one. Learn from them. There are going to be dead ends. Instead of continuing to read through endless threads of interest, find something new to read and start. This will save you a ton of time and aggravation the next time you find yourself reading through the same thread over and over. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was appalling””#‎mentions,”””””””””””””. The point was to get conversation starters going, and the response was terrible. The problem was that the chatbot was written entirely to be disliked by the public. They were not interested in being conversed with, and the opposite was true: they were interested in being conversed with, but not terribly deeply. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe. This does not mean that there have not been any advances; on the contrary, there have been a ton. The most notable example is the Twitter chatbot, which was intended to be an interactive chatbot for Twitter users. The end result was hilariously stupid, and led to the creation of much more intelligent chatbots. This does not mean that there have not been any advances; on the contrary, there have been a ton. One of the primary issues with AI is that it is a icky field to start with. The first thing that should go is the source of the problem. If the problem is that humans are making terrible artificial intelligence decisions, there are a number of things that can be done to decrease the chances that this happens. The first and most obvious thing is to stop being an asshole. There are plenty of examples of people yelling at AI to do its job, only to have the effect of making the AI do what the person didn’t’t’t say. This does not a nice personality make, and will likely come from individuals interacting with the AI. It is equally important to realize that artificial intelligence is just one facet of a much broader society, and that human-robot interaction is just one facet of a much broader society, to which I will return to shortly. _____________________________________________________________________________________

Human-robot interaction is just one facet of a much broader society. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Humans have been collaborating with robots for far too long to just change the script and stop now. The gap is going to have to be filled, and jobs that used to be filled by men will now be filled by men. The best that can be hoped for is that the gap is filled by people with similar mindsets and aspirations, but who will act upon these mindsets and aspirations. There are many examples across human-robot interaction where the rookie performs admirably, but the franchise is passed on to the newer brother. This is a bad thing in my view, as it allows the franchise to progress, but ultimately the viewers are left wondering what the hell was wrong with the first film? The most common example I can think of is in medical research. It is extremely difficult to develop a working prosthesis for a man, much less a humanoid one, so humanoid robots have been created. This is a good thing, as it allows humans with physical impairments to have a different type of experience to robots, but it is a bad thing in that it allows man-robot interaction to progress apace. There are several other areas where humanoid robots have been used, and while some of these seem like good ideas at first, the end result is a cluttered field with very little to no product to show for it. _____________________________________________________________________________________

Human-robot interaction is just one facet of a much broader society. _____________________________________________________________________________________ There are many other industries where humanoid robots have already been used, and while some of these seem like good ideas at first, the end result is a glut of mediocre robots that don’t’t’t’tinker with electronic devices,”””””””””””””””””””””””

====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they can be used by anyone with some basic coding knowledge to do anything from send mass unsolicited emails to combat cancer. The problem with this is that’it won't take long for the general public to realize that it is a good idea to limit the options available to people with brain injuries. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they are difficult to implement correctly. The following are some examples of problems that could be brought by implementing a incorrect solution: • Improving the security of medical imaging datasets. Medical imaging datasets have become a common target for hackers, and there are already reports of users complaining that the images they have uploaded are sexually assaulted. It is entirely possible that images uploaded by hackers will in some way be used by advertisers to showcase products and services, and this will result in the leak of intimate details about users. This would not be a problem if the results had been positive, but this would not be a problem if the results had been negative. Therefore, there is a conflict of interest between improving the results and promoting a product which does not exist. This leads to the grey area of "what if?" games: what if we had instead focused our efforts on developing the exactly the product we wanted to sell? This is a difficult question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

There are also practical issues which stem directly from the grey area. When did it stop being about the theoretical and just get to the practical? If you are looking to buy a house, what do you do with the extra money? There are going to be many issues which can be caused by differentiating between a human and a robot. It is entirely possible that a product does not exist which takes the form expected: car, chair, etc. The question is how to get around this? It is entirely possible that no such product exists and that we are talking about a black-box operation. This is a point which I will not get into here as it is beyond the scope of this article, but is a good example that it is extremely hard to anticipate all the ways in which a system can be misused.

Finally, there is the issue of waste. This is probably the most important issue to realize about any new technology. How do we ensure that the most basic tasks are completed? If the system is not used for what it is supposed to be, what do we do with the users? Obviously, there has to be some sort of reward for using an automated system, but how do we redistribute the burden? Companies such as Amazon are offering cash rewards for customers to use their robots for household tasks. This is a good example that it is entirely possible to anticipate all the ways in which automated systems can be misused. 

One of the primary issues will be that artificial intelligence is not a replacement for humans. There will undoubtedly be cases in which it is beneficial to assist people, but this will inevitably lead to different standards of care. A person with limited intelligence could potentially replace an entire surgical team by learning how to do a particular task, and this is a good example that it is entirely possible to anticipate all the ways in which automated systems can be misused.

It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is not perfect. AIs are not perfect, and they cannot. This is why it is important to understand and embrace the fact that AIs are just that: AIs. They are very capable, but they are not perfect. They are very likely to make terrible decisions, and they are not here to protect you. They are here to help. They will be trained and supervised and ultimately allowed to replace humans at work, high schools, and in the military. There will be panic and criticism, but ultimately, we will learn to accept this as a natural process. 

‎The important thing to realize is that artificial intelligence is not here to protect you. It is here to help a select few at the expense of the average Joe and Jane. 

There is a marked difference between the level of concern felt by businesses and the level of implementation. The majority of companies that have taken up the challenge have been extremely cautious, and have focused on testing the limits of their AIs to the fullest. This has included building medical testing equipment entirely with AIs, and even shopping online by scanning shoppers. The potential for abuse is terrifying, and is precisely what businesses are meant to avoid. The reality is that artificial intelligence is coming, and it will not take long for the first signs to show up to point to disastrous results. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is not here to protect you. It is here to help a select few at the expense of the average Joe and Jane. This does not to say that there are none of the most basic needs of a human being left, it only means that we have not yet mastered the art of serving them. We are still learning.

====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they often omit important details. For example, take the following image classification image:


The image features are clearly labeled, but not all of the details are obvious:

Unclear what to do with the unidentifiable students?

Anecdotally, I've seen this question asked hundreds of times:

Probably best left unasked is that it is virtually impossible to train a classifier on the results of its own failures.

It is important to realize that deepfakes are not perfect. A number of image classification libraries have already released open source implementations that are almost certainly much, much worse than the original. Google’s TensorFlow is an obvious candidate, as it is a library intended to be used with n00bs likeminded engineers. In the interest of full disclosure, I should mention that I am on the advisory board for OpenCV, an open source implementation of the Klein–Mann–Baxbert classification algorithm. Their cardigan example is actually parodied perfectly in the movie Blade Runner 2049, in which the character Wong details how to build an artificial neural network from scratch. Their breakout cardigan is actually this:

Wong equips his artificial neural network with a deck of 52 holoband tennis cards, and it just won handily. Their point is that by sharing their newfound knowledge with the world, they have given rise to a business opportunity. OpenCV has not responded with an announcement of when they will, or will not, release an open source implementation of their neural network, and I will not hold my breath. Thiel co-founded PayPal with Reid Hoffman, and they have refused to release an open source implementation of their AI, which is disappointing, but not surprising. Their bottom line is that Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft, the companies that will be the most affected by an AI, have not yet released their open source implementations, which is disappointing, but not unexpected. It is important to realize that despite what people who oppose AI may believe, humans are often wrong about most things. Oracle’s “BigM” AI was supposed to be a replacement for English wasp, but instead, debuted as a misogynistic piece of software. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

This is clearly not the correct way to go about things, but showcases that AI is still a long way from being universally understood.

AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the data that is returned is often restricted to a narrow set of professionals. This is because data entry is a rat race: the more data you have to go through to extract, analyze, and pass along, the more errors you will encounter. This is why cloud computing has taken off: it can drastically cut down on error rates, and also allow people with simpler needs to participate. In the long run, this could have a ripple effect throughout the AI-building process: machines that are smarter than humans will inevitably be programmed with human-like abilities, and humanity will be the benevolent superintelligence.

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us?

====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they often do more harm than good. The classic example is the movie The Matrix, which showed a human being as a hologram talking to another human being. The response was mixed, with some people saying that the system was too realistic to be realistic, and that the system should have been taken off the market. Another popular example is Google Photos, which showed photographs of people based on their results, rather than on any kind of objective criteria. This might sound like a perfect system to have, until you realize that it has led to the introduction of SRS (system-sensitive grading), which is when grades are given based solely on past performance. This is clearly not a good system to have, but is often employed in education systems because it allows for more flexible and customizable systems, which is a good thing. The final major issue is that artificial intelligence will inevitably disrupt menial jobs. This will shift the burden of supporting an army of data scientists and hackers to the consumer, who will have to pick up the slack. This is a difficult pill to swallow, but should be required if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will inevitably disrupt menial jobs. That is not to say that there aren't any-’le jobs that AI won’t handle fantastically.” However, the vast majority of jobs will not be able to be automated. Banking will likely be the most prominent example, as AI is already incredibly smart and will likely detect patterns to maximize its returns. Additionally, software will soon be able to diagnose and prevent disease, which is a field that has been dominated by human experts. Furthermore, medical research will almost certainly be conducted using artificial intelligence until it is deemed unethical. The final major field of application is in medical diagnostics, which will almost certainly be done with artificial intelligence. This will be done by developing diagnostic algorithms that can be applied to any situation that presents itself. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on developing more precise and tailored treatments. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by these treatments. Some people may argue that this is their fault if they don’t develop diagnostic algorithms, but it is entirely possible that the faulty algorithms resulted in the deaths of hundreds if not thousands of patients. Furthermore, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by these treatments. Some people may argue that that is their fault if they don’t develop diagnostic algorithms, but that is entirely possible to do. AIs are trained for extremely low-level tasks, and if the output is anything less than stellar, the job is lost. Furthermore, this does not take into account the fact that artificial intelligence will inevitably be applied to more and more fields until it becomes unprofitable to study it. Finally, one of the greatest untapped fields of AI is in the area of robotics. This is a field where artificial intelligence has the potential to revolutionize the way we do virtually every task that a human being can imagine. Currently, robots are capable of performing tasks such as picking up trash, delivering packages, and transporting heavy objects that are completely beyond the capabilities of a human being. Furthermore, this does not take into account the fact that most robots will be able to learn and adapt to their new roles. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on developing more precise and tailored treatments. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by these treatments. Some people may argue that that is their fault if they don’t develop robotic assistants, but that is entirely possible to do. AIs are already incredibly powerful and should be treated as such. Furthermore, there is the unappreciated value in having an AI that is as accurate as possible. That said, this does not mean that there are not any™s that are not as smart as you. This is largely a function of the fact that the AIs have not been given a chance to develop up to the degree that humans have. Furthermore, there are no clear answers as to how to redistribute the wealth generated by artificial intelligence. Ultimately, this is a matter for the individuals in question to decide.

====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they usually have terrible audio. Amazon’s response was to stop selling the product, and now only sell it through third-party vendors. This is a good example that it is hard to anticipate all the ways in which a new technology can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s solution was to remove the advertising from the product, which is a good one, but still not nearly as good as IBM’s “No Fresh Fresh† initiative, which provided cash incentives to anyone who could generate a new batch of customers. This initiative was criticized for being too sweet, but the point is that AI should not be built to hate. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that AI is still very young; things like robot hearing can be a disaster from the getgo, and there are virtually no signs that we will see any sort of restrictions on automation. This means that we will likely see various forms of automation -- e.g., artificial intelligence that mimics humans, talents like biosimilars, and so on -- but also various forms of autonomy -- e.g., autonomy for robots to be doctors, lawyers, and so on -- that are difficult to classify. The most common example is self-driving cars, which are incredibly dangerous tools but which are being developed at an alarming rate. This will not be kind to human beings; there will undoubtedly be a marked upsurge in workplace accidents between now and the mid- to late-2040s. The other major cause is nutrition: artificial intelligence will eventually be able to image and mimic the features of humans, personality traits, and so on, which will make training for them much more difficult. There will also undoubtedly be a surge in the use of automation in industries such as manufacturing, where the margins are incredibly low and the costs are astronomical. This is by no means a guarantee, but it is a start. It will not be long before artificial intelligence is able to do everything a human being can, and there will be a massive upsurge in the usage of human-like intelligence. This is largely a Good Thing, as it allows for a host of human-human interactions to be had, but also opens the door to a host of new ills, such as neurological defects and cybernetic enhancements. The most obvious example is brain-computer interfaces, which have been developed and are undergoing clinical trials. This is a very exciting field, and I strongly encourage you to explore the web sites of as many relevant companies as possible. There are also research labs and implementation offices all over the place, and if you know how to get to one, you can pretty much do anything. Finally, one of the best things that has come out of human-robot interaction is trust. Initial introductions were often disastrous -- e.g., the wooeley-looking assistant from AIs No, Actually, will are made. This will almost certainly be replaced by a more welcoming and amiable AI will almost certainly be able to. Initial introductions were often disastrous -- e.g., the wooeley-looking assistant from AIs HAL on, and IBM’s concept of a "honest-but-not-perfect" AI. These AIs were widely regarded as enormously ambitious, but with the potential to open up entirely new areas of research and commerce. These AIs have now moved onto the drawing board, and it is important to remember that they are still a ways off. Up until now, we have only been discussing up to date issues, but there will inevitably be some disruption in the area of areas such as areas of expertise, and so on. This is by no means a perfect analogy, but it is a good starting point. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. In the long run, this will be inevitable: simple models are easier to understand, and more natural users will be brought up with. Furthermore, humans are by far the most intelligent creatures on the planet, and it is our intellectual property that is on the line. This means that even simple AI will be modified in ways that are not only bad for humanity, but also the ecosystem as a whole. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is not inevitable. We have only just begun. The most common example is automated weaponry: weapons that are extremely accurate, but have no regard for the consequences. This is the type of thing that the Japanese used to train sharks to kill humans. This is a very dangerous field to be in, and it is not a field that has been freely explored in any capacity. There are a host of other issues that are not entirely clear, but are almost certainly disastrous. The field of biopics is particularly interesting: what kind of ramifications will this have on people's lives?
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they usually have the following issues: A) Users won't be able to distinguish the original image format from a shallow clone. This is why deepfakes start with -dfoo:memory:gigapixels. This may or may not be a problem in practice, but I strongly suggest against it. B) Duplicates will show up in search results, which is a huge missed opportunity. C) Removed features may never be reinstated, which is a nightmare scenario to be in. D) Lack of clear guidelines on when to remove an API may lead to situations of "I don't know, please don't do that" situations where people try to do something illegal BECAUSE IT ALREADY EXISTS This is not to say that everything that is not touched by an API is bad. Strong AI is a wonderful thing, and will absolutely revolutionize our field of neurology. However, everything from molecular biology to robotics should be treated with the utmost caution. Too much progress is being made and I am afraid that we are on the verge of a disaster that will shake the foundations of humanity to the core. 

To be clear, I am not saying that AI is not useful. In fact, I would argue that it is extremely useful. However, the following points should serve as the foundation on which any AI is built: A) Do no emulate AIs. B) Utilize whichever techniques/techniques/gadgets/corpses/whatever you can. This will almost always yield superior results. C) Remember that the more complex an AI is, the more mental load it will have. Therefore, better to miscalculate than to go over the edge. D) Always ask questions. Everyone does. E) ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ Be respectful of others. Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing and has many fascinating facets to it. Don't get in their way! ❤️

These are by no means exhaustive guidelines. There are bound to be many areas where the AI community can and should be discussing these issues with one another. At its core, however, this is a discussion about how to best apply technology to the task at hand. 

In short, we must never let up on our quest for superior intelligence. —G.A. Cohen

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will not be able to replace humans. That is to say, artificial intelligence will not be able to intelligently accomplish tasks that humans possess of reaching such a state. Instead, the vast majority of AI contributions to the labor force will be in areas such as health care, financial analysis, and data entry. These are the areas in which AI is most likely to excel. Furthermore, it is important to realize that AI is not perfect. AIs are trained and tested to achieve extremely narrow objectives such as achieving extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), and toil away at unfinished projects (often, what ends up in a product is not what is sold). This leaves a large swathe of AI with no idea how to complete their respective task, and is a major cause of the recent surge in employee unhappiness. It is important to realize that AI is not perfect. AIs are trained and tested to reach extremely low accuracy (usually, anything below 90%), and toil away at unfinished projects (often, what ends up in a product is not what is sold). This leaves a large swathe of AI with no idea how to effectively use their knowledge, and is a major cause of the recent rise in employee dissatisfaction. —Satoshi Tajiri, Master of Disguise, showed that AI is unable to correctly predict the personality of a human being. Most AIs fail this test, and instead choose to focus on impossible tasks such as reading minds. This is why AIs are so hard to train for, and it is estimated that up to one-fifth of all AI submissions fail. It is important to realize that AI is not perfect. AIs are trained and tested to reach extremely low accuracy (usually, anything below 90%), and toil away at unfinished projects (often, what ends up in a product is not what is sold). This leaves a large swathe of AI with no idea how to effectively use their knowledge, and is a major cause of the recent rise in employee dissatisfaction. It is important to realize that AI is not perfect. —Wilbur Ross, President of The Philippines, is probably the most famous example of an AIs failed job. Ross, an investor in a drug company, brought a massive recruitment bust to the Philippines by asking the population what color shoes to wear. The correct answer was black, which caused massive outrage in the country, which in turn led to Ross being fired. This is an extreme example, but demonstrates that AI is unable to correctly predict the personality of a human being. Most AIs fail this test,
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they inevitably lead to imitators: take, for instance, the television show Community, in which engineers would post reviews of their products across social media and recommend improvements. Of course, this only served to inspire competitors to copy the template, leading to a vicious circle of escalating consumer demand, increasing competition, and so on. Such problems are often difficult to detect in the wild, but are indicative of under-developed systems.

Unintended Consequences of New Thinking/ Bad Implementation / Outdated Technologies Lately, I've been hearing a lot about "bad implementations" and "outdated technologies." This is often misconstrued to mean that problems shouldn't be faced, but rather that solutions should be found that are as good or better. This is not to say that problems don’t need to be solved, only that they will not be found unless we prioritize the problem of how to do so. Furthermore, this argument does not necessarily lead to better solutions; rather, to more complex and/or conflicting applications of the same idea. Instead, this could easily be seen as an example of men learning new languages: humans are inherently better at problem-solving than machines, and replacing a human with a machine would be no exception. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are entire websites dedicated to reproducing certain types of images. Deepfakes can be amusing at times, but
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that the target market for deepfakes is pedophiles, but deepfakes have also been distributed to assbate people with mental illness, to mock people with disabilities, and to promote Apple products. The most egregious example of a deepfakeshw crashed an app showed off at Defcon 15 was a game called "Narcissist Army", which showed a person with no mental illness taking over the brains of people with no mental illness. The usage of this as a marketing tool goes way beyond this, as this could prove disastrous in high-risk settings, such as gaming. The British government has ordered all augmented and virtual reality games to include this. This is a very small minority of uses, but shows that there is a demand. A system which included the Bias Assessment Tool would have found many uses for this, but because it is a administrative tool, it is not funded by the project. This is also a small minority of uses, but shows that there is a demand. ANTs are also probably the most abused of any mental illness, and have been used to great extents to push weight loss, increase productivity, and to promote meditation. This is a very small minority of uses, but shows that there is a demand. Nervous system: This could refer to anything that isn't specifically designed to make you uncomfortable. The most common examples include cupcakes with sex objects, and Martian candy corn. Nervous system: Am I Nervous? Am I Experienced With This?✩ Am I Rely[ing] Too Much On This? If the above four questions are "Yes", then you should definitely get a new job! If the above four questions are "No", then this should probably be taken as a sign that you should probably just move to South Korea. Nervous system: This could also be applied to any mental task that is not physically demanding. This could include playing video games, completing simple exams, or relaxing. Nervous system: I Can Do This! If This Then That! ❤️‍♀️ If this is not obvious, please do not ask for help when you are drunk. This is one of the most under-appreciated aspects of any job. The more people who can identify when they are tripping and fix it, the more likely this will be the case. Also, systems that automatically identify and fix software bugs will find a wide variety of commercial customers. Lastly, artificial intelligence is advancing at an exponential rate and is going to change everything. Whether you use it in your personal or commercial product is completely up to you.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––

The final major class of job is those that don’t even exist. This category includes apps, streaming media players, and, to a lesser extent, home automation. These AIs are often highly intelligent but typically not very friendly. Home AIs have a strong preference for performing specific tasks, which can lead to disastrous results. Examples include the AIs that can cut your hair in half, open the refrigerator remotely, and sterilize objects. Because of this, home AI is typically only used in small companies, and is generally only funded with money from wealthy individuals and governments. In short, this is the kind of AI that nobody uses. Bias: Unfair. Unfair, unfair!? If the above three statements are true, then yes, home AI is definitely AIs. Furthermore, this should terrify you. Why do we want to work with AIs? Because they are quick, accurate, and generally efficient. Additionally, there is the convenience factor: I don’t have to deal with humans disrupting my day, and potentially ruining my career. Finally, there is the statement that "if it can be automated, should it be?”?" The short answer is "No". AIs should only be employed on a contract if there is absolutely no downside.e For example, let's say that there are there are andkpop stars who are overweight. What do you do? You contract the AIs to create AI that is considered to be healthy. This is a bad idea, and would lead to the rise of the *NECKLIFT* which is extremely unhealthy. The second worst idea is to have AIs that are intelligent enough to understand and learn from your own mistakes. This is what we have seen with Google’s Google’s Glass. The final and worst type of AIs is one that is too intelligent to understand, but not smart enough to be an AIs with a high enough barrier to entry. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology”. This was an AI that could detect breast and cervical cancer and recommend appropriate treatment. The problem with this is that it was too smart for the context, and the general public didn’t realize that they were referring to a creepy medical diagnosis. Microsoft�
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they often end up being too good to be true. A student took an internship at Google, which the head of HR called a "dumb" idea. Uber’s new policy of refusing female drivers led to a flood of sexist tweets, which was met with the usual stream of misogynistic tweets. The problem with this is that it leads us to the other extreme: there are obvious conflicts of interest arising from hiring someone to do a job for you when you can have the exact same person do it for free. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, space exploration, and the medical field, to name a few. The best-case scenario is that such a program is well suited for, and will work fairly well with, people with a particular skill set. The problem with this is that it opens up the door to exploitation: someone with no knowledge of robotics can programming their way to an automated task. There are a host of other problems with this, such as introducing any new concept into a field that has already solved the previous one, and potentially losing any theoretical advantage that might accrue from the transition. The most common form of automated destruction is through cancer diagnostic AI, which is described in detail in Willem Buiter's book The End of Intelligence. Another common danger is in the research community, which tends to be highly technical and theoretical, which can lead to the common pitfall of applying their theoretical breakthroughs to real-world applications: for example, the Google Photos image recognition algorithm has been applied to detect mugshots, which is a very real and scary thing to do. Wider implications can be had by treating machine intelligence like a toolkit, and teaching it how to do what it is good at. This could have a number of interesting implications, from making artificial intelligence more ethical to promoting greater creativity. Finally, there is the matter of moral hazard: it is extremely rare that a real-world application will yield a world-changing result, and in most cases, that will be the exception rather than the rule. It is entirely possible that the majority of new ideas will be mishandled by engineers to the detriment of humanity, and that any resulting moral panache will be lost on the public. One of the primary ways to prevent this is to make it as hard as possible for engineers to get their hands on a new idea, which will inevitably lead to a decline in new ideas. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us?

====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they do not adhere to Google's high standards for quality. A high-quality deepfakes will not improve the user experience, but rather, will ensure that the userbase remains dominated by the Google app store. This is a bad thing, as bloated software can lead to large-scale development costs, reduced innovation due to lack of clarity, and a host of other undesirable consequences. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that the definition of shallow is anyone but the government. If someone wants to make a movie about how to get laid using reverse engineering, they should be able to. The problem with this is that there are going to be people who say "but it would benefit people!" This is a good thing. The problem with this is that people who benefit will be people with money. There are going to be protests about this. The best thing for everyone is for everyone to realize that this is a good thing. There will be a point where this doesn't apply and everyone will just learn to deal with it. 

68. ಠ_ಠ

This one is a bit trickier. There are going to be people who say "but why?" The simple answer is that there are going to be people who don’t understand. People who are unfamiliar with the philosophical underpinnings of this will likely respond by saying "oh, it just goes to sales!" This is absolutely correct. However, there are going to be people who will misunderstand this and think that only sales professionals understand this stuff. This is completely counterintuitive. The most common example of someone not knowing something is anagramming. An anagram is simply a sentence that does not exist in its correct form. For example, take the following sentence: "The apple flew away from the can." This sentence will most likely not occur to anyone who has never written an anagram. This is also why AIs are incredibly hard to perfect: they don’t exist in the lab, so to speak, and so there was no way to anagram a hard question such as "what is a bic?" This is also why Twitter chatbots are incredibly hard to understand: they are chatbots, and chatbots are meant to be understood. Therefore, it does not take a genius to figure out that they were trying to be funny. 

67. ಠ_ಠ

This one is a bit trickier. The simplest and probably the most fallacious form of meme is to create a meme that is completely unrelated to the topic at hand and then troll the shit out of it. This is essentially what memegen was originally meant for. The problem with memegen is that it has been used so broadly that it has become almost impossible to remain original. There are bound to be imitators and wannabes, and it is entirely possible that these imitators and wannabes will be able to sell the same product or service that memegen is trying to disrupt. The same will probably be true for wannabes: if your idea is dumb enough that the guys in the club all start singing your praises, you may not get too many votes. This is why it is so important for a startup to have a clear idea of what it is trying to do from the getgo. If it is too chaotic, there is a good chance that the new idea will be implemented but with unintended consequences.

Without going into too much detail, this explains why most Anki decks don’t have a problem with Anki decklists: people are more than happy to learn how to use anki decks, and it is much more difficult to give a bad example than a good one. Furthermore, it is entirely possible that the person taking the class is not even that smart, but more interested
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they are hard to read. Furthermore, they are often wrong more than a hundred percent of the time. The final issue with deepfakes is that they are memory leaks. If the player character uses a deepfakes levelled list as the AI for a conversation, then any other AI capable of thinking like that will automatically be augmented with the latest in AI. This will be a very expensive to train system and will not be in use for very long, but could have a profound effect on human-robot interaction.

Human-robot interaction is a complex field to fully understand, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward. There are a number of approaches that have been explored, but none have quite hit the bullseye yet. One of the most promising approaches is to overlay a human mind with an artificial intelligence. This would allow the user to interface with the AI directly, without needing to build a complex cognitive interface. This is incredibly exciting, but requires an immense amount of development work to pull off. The most exciting (and terrifying) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. This is a field that has been incredibly under-regulated, but is expected to revolutionize the way we die. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. This is a completely new class of robots and it will not take long for them to creep up on them. This is when the spine-chilling implications of excess weight start to show. There are going to be so many conflicts that have to be addressed that it is simply impossible to list them all. This post is going to be incredibly long and unprofitable, so I ask that you please consider donating a small amount of your hard-earned money to the cause. It really does help. 

Okay, so what do we do with the trash? 

There are a number of different approaches that can be taken with garbage. Even though garbage is usually NOT stored as data, it is often used in software that is. This means that anything that can be represented as data is automatically assumed to be useful. For example, take the movie dataset that is used in most database applications. If you plugged in a movie title and ran some SQL queries, the results would usually be awesome. However, this will not be the case if the query was assumed to be accurate to some degree. For example, let's say that you were trying to predict which of three sex robots will win a sex contest. The correct answer is going to be a sex robot, because that is what is being predicted. However, this will not be the case if the question was assumed to be accurate to some degree. An awesome sex robot will most likely be developed and sold to meet the sexual preferences of a select few. This is going to be one of the most disruptive technologies in history. What do we do with the trash?hundreds of billions of data points? This data will be incredibly useful, but also profoundly unhelpful. To put this in perspective, take a minute and think about what would happen if all the data was used to create headless AI. This is a very broad category, but it describes everything from sex robots to medical-device assistants. This is not to say that we should not be creating such a device, but it is a dangerous venture and we should not get started without a proper regulatory framework in place. What should go into AIs? Datasets? The solution? Asians! AIs should be constructed so that they can interact with humans. This does not have to be an Asian person, necessarily, but one that is interested in meeting human beings. This would allow for a wide variety of cultural differences to no longer exist, and it would be incredibly exciting to watch. Finally, there is the matter of the body. Humans have been developing artificial intelligence to a high degree of complexity, and it is up to society at large to decide if we as a species are capable of handling the resulting cognitive and emotional overload. This is a difficult issue to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

Okay, so what do we do with the trash?

There are a multitude of different ways in which garbage can be used. There are obvious uses, such as storing huge amounts of data and speeding up data analysis. However, there are also obvious uses that are less obvious. For example, there are potential uses which are not immediately obvious. For example, there are no easy answers here. There are also potential conflicts of interest arising from this. For example, could a customer with a personal injury law firm end up working for a consumer product company? This is a difficult question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they often reduce their originals to imitators: take the below image for example: this is not a realistic-looking face would an anon submit it? this is not a good example because it shows that not all AI is created equal. The more abstract the better, but unfortunately often the case) so here we have a Japanese engineering student creating an AI that would replace illustrators with robots. this is not a good example because it gives the impression that there is a universal standard to which all AI should be compared, this is most obviously seen in Google’s DeepMind AI, which was able to defeat the world champion at Go, but this did not extend to moderating the clearnet, which is a much more individual case. this is not a good example because it implies that AI is somehow inherently bad, and this is clearly not the case, but this is where we will start.

oligopolānē: the new Hitler of AI

oligopolānē is an AI that can be used to improve the quality of life for some people. this is obviously not a good example because it implies that AI is inherently bad, and this is not a good example because it gives the impression that there is a universal standard to which all AI should be compared, this is most obviously seen in Google’s DeepMind AI, which was able to defeat the world champion at Go, but this did not extend to moderating the clearnet, which is a much more individual case.

oligopolānē was initially introduced as the Google Photos replacement, but this was quickly picked up by media outlets and quickly shifted to the front page of the next day's paper: the new Hitler of AI.

oligopolānē was originally a Google Summer Of Code project, which offered students a $50 Amazon gift card if they could come up with a proof of concept for a cloud-based image classification application. the proof of concept was quickly abandoned, because it offered no new insights, and instead merely shifted the goalposts of the problem space.

oligopolānē has since been extended to include screening pornography, and ultimately any image or video that suggests an abnormality. this is already a field that is dominated by men, and olimpolis is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how powerful the effects can be.

oligopolānē is not the only example. flickr image recognition came to resemble Oklahoma highway patrol: if you take an image of a person, and add a few notes, you will eventually be able to identify them by their photo. this was widely criticised, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how powerful the effects can be.

oligopolānē is not the only example. carpal tunnel has now spread to other industries: architects no longer need to be supervised for every project, because all the info is in the resume, every company website has an hr hand for every question, and theres even a twitter account for people to ask questions about their architecture. this is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how powerful the effects can be.

oligopolānē is not the only example. sex robots have now been developed: these are supposed to be 100% comfortable, have sensory feedback to pleasure the user, and be emotionally responsive. this is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how powerful the effects can be.

oligopolānē is not the only example. data mining has now spread to medicine: hospitals use data mining to weed out cancer patients, and chose radiology because they said it sounded cooler. this is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how powerful the effects can be.

oligopolānē is not the only example. there are over 200,000 articles and books on AI that have been written on <tries to be funny here> futility, and it is mostly by people who have never done anything interesting that this point is made. it is important to realize that this does not mean we do not pursue anything that is potentially revolutionary, just that we do not think twice about what consequences this might have.

oligopolānē is not the only example. there will be a technological singularity: somewhere between us and the singularity, there will be no longer be anything human about anything, and everything will be automated. this is a very scary thought to think about, and probably not very many people have come to terms with it.

oligopolānē is not the only example. there will be a space age imitator: put simply, an imitator of what? this is a hard one to nail down, but could definitely lead to the downfall of the human race. there are a variety of possible answers, but they all stem back to one fundamental issue: self-driving
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they often do more harm than good. The most common examples include NVIDIA's Surround feature, which is intended to augment the standard 2D/3D video output and consists of a stereo array with some limited image stabilization, and AMD's A-Tuning technology, which allows a limited subset of the GPU's compute power to be devoted to manual tuning of the GPU's P90X GPU (Power, Energy, and Negative Kun) architecture. The final notable example is NVIDIA's Tensor Processing Units, which are used to simulate neural networks, and are widely employed in deep learning libraries. These devices have a 1 in 5,000 chance of occurring, and are widely considered to be a 'toy' in an attempt to improve the 'real world' performance of AI. This last example is by no means a perfect solution, but showcases that AI is an ever-evolving field, and that we will need to come up with new and creative ways to address existing problems.

Human-robot interaction: Is this even a problem? Google has already begun to demonstrate the feasibility of being able to easily and sensibly interface with robots. This will not only dramatically improve the quality of life for everyone involved, but also pave the way for a host of other benefits, such as: • Increasingly common lab-based tasks such as analysing brain scans will no longer be difficult to automate • Improving the quality of medical care will almost certainly require no less than the most sophisticated medical equipment • Delivering on promising medical breakthroughs will almost certainly require some combination of R&D funds, local governments, and academia • Translating these findings into any language other than its original target tongue is a major undertaking, and most notably difficult to detect. • Ultimately, most successful transfers will be as a byproduct of better medical technology, and not as a standalone benefit.

Even though this loss of autonomy will not be apparent to the general public for at least the next 20 years, there is a clear and present danger that it will cause immense damage to human-robot interaction. This is largely because of the way in which AI is likely to be used: generalised AI is likely to be used for a wide variety of purposes, from disaster response to surveillance, to the acquisition of medical knowledge, and the construction of any device/systems capable of performing those tasks. This is not to say that there aren't any obvious and useful applications, but it is important to realize that their directionality will cause considerable disruption and anxiety. The most common examples include automated translation, the development of robotic medical assistants, and the manufacturing of everything from vaccines to windows). It is important to realize that these directionsality will cause considerable disruption and anxiety. The most common examples include autonomous translation, the development of robotic medical assistants, and the construction of anything that can perform any task that is inherently difficult or impossible, to the detriment of human beings’s well being. It is also important to realize that these disruptions will be much more subtle than that, and that most of the attention will be on Google’s AIs. That is to say, AIs are likely to start out with undesirable properties, gradually improve them, and then move on to normal AI behavior. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humanity to focus on more important things like curing cancer, advancing technology, and creating the kinds of jobs that will actually pay decent money. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is not inevitable. There will be ferocious battles between its positive and negative effects, but ultimately we will win. This is because anything that can be categorized as a "Good" or "Bad" Effect is going to be countered with an "Au!?" by some new better theory. The more perfect a machine is, the more likely it is that it is not perfect. This is why it is so important for engineers to think creatively about how to get around this. For instance, how do we ensure that holograms are not used to brainwash people into becoming robots? It is entirely possible that this will in fact be a good thing, as it will force people to think more holistically. 

Human-robot interaction: Are we done? It is important to realize that this isn’t to say that there aren’t going to be no problems. There will undoubtedly be disruptive technologies that fundamentally alter how we do business, and we will have to adapt. This is especially true if our primary goal is to create reliable, useful products. However, we also need to realize that these changes are likely to be resisted by a large portion of the human population.
====================
The problem with deepfakes is that they are very hard to detect in the wild. The New York Times reported that they could not find a single article mentioning deepfakes in their database. Google announced in July that they would no longer allow the public to submit deepfakes for review. This is a good example that it is better to err on the side of caution when it comes to extending intellectual property. Creative Commons licenses allow anyone to remix, transform, and build upon any work of literature or art, and this has led to a wave of academic research focusing on extending intellectual property to handle these situations. The most notable example is the open-source video game engine, which was created by a student at Carnegie Mellon University. This gave rise to interest in medical diagnostics, which was then used to create the open-source videogame engine, which was used to create the critically acclaimed video game BioShock. This may not seem like a very exciting example, but bear in mind that this is only a piece of the puzzle. The more interesting examples are those that extend upon this, and this is when things get really interesting. 

Consider, for example, the television series "Harry Potter." This show was created by a large team of people, and the final product was a highly praised but extremely challenging task. The project was funded with a large-scale campaign, and the final product is considered to be a commercial success. This points to the larger issue of a large-scale, but ultimately unsuccessful, attempt at extending intellectual property. Commercial success or not, attempts at extending intellectual property can lead to a wave of academic research, which in turn leads to commercial success. This is the exact sort of thing that commercial drones will attempt to mimic. 

In short, attempts at extending intellectual property can lead to a host of academic and commercial failures. It is important to realize that attempts at this will not be accidental. A culture of perfection is promoted, and anything less is considered crummy. A chaotic environment is created, and efforts are made to ensure that the result is as chaotic as possible. Averting this result is difficult, but ultimately inevitable. 

Another important point to make is that attempts at this will not be accidental. A culture of perfection is promoted, and anything less is considered crummy. A chaotic environment is created, and efforts are made to ensure that the result is as chaotic as possible. Achieving this is difficult, but ultimately inevitable.

Similar to the film "Blade Runner 2049," which showed an artificial intelligence being developed by a small team, this points to the larger issue of a focused, but ultimately unsuccessful effort. Commercial success or not, artificial intelligence will most likely be developed by a small team, and efforts are made to ensure that the result is as accurate as possible. A chaotic environment is created, and efforts are made to ensure that the result is as accurate as possible. Achieving this is hard, but ultimately inevitable.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly advancing, but little is known about the various variables that will be involved. From here, various applications have been generated, such as mass-produced humanoid robots, to portable humanoid robots, and automotive automation. The most common and versatile application is in the humanoid robot genre, where AIs are humanoid robots that are identical to humans but with enhanced physical attributes. There are also developmental AIs, who are based on data collected by humans and are not intended to be sentient. There are also hobbyist and research AIs, who are not considered conforming to the general artificial intelligence community but are nonetheless interesting. There have been a number incidents in which AIs have violated humans' rights, and it is important to realize that this will not be tolerated. This is different from AIウルド, which is the generic term used for AI used in marketing and research, where the emphasis is on developing hardware/software that is intelligent. AIs that are intelligent but not conscious is a completely different matter entirely.

The problem with deepfakes is that they often go viral and are extremely lucrative opportunities. The initial AI that is created will most likely be an AI for coding to improve education or research, and these gains will likely be lost on the public if this is the case. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI.

The problem with deepfakes is that they tend to be repetitive and unhelpful. The most common examples of deepfakes include: 1. Replacing A >>> with B A. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures. 2. Replacing N >>>m by U A. This is an incredibly stupid way to go about things, but nonetheless demonstrates that AI still has a long way to go. The majority of AI found today is intended to aid a task/student/pet/whatever.

The problem with deepfakes is that they are hard to detect. The media has already picked up on this and is publishing articles and interviews that hype up the deepfakes to the media. This will only lead to more hype and media coverage. The real issue is that this will lead to the creation of a massive database of people with no social skills who will be used to produce pornography and sell it to desperate customers. This could easily be turned around on humans by having them play the parts of customers and customers of customers. This is a much more palatable option to dealing with customers who are unresponsive or unwilling to make any kind of payment-related repairs. The problem with games is that they are broken due to in-game microtransactions. One of the primary issues is that players are unlikely to realize that they are playing a video game until it is too late. Furthermore, this will in many cases lead to the gaming industry shifting to an economy in which every click is a profit center. This is a dangerous direction to take and one that the gaming industry has yet to fully embrace.

This is a very big if to ask, and I do not have any earthly idea how to handle it.

This is a strong indication that an artificial intelligence is in the works.

This is a strong indication that an artificial intelligence is in work/arena/brain? This is an interesting one. In the long run, this could end up being good. On the other hand, we are on a very strange path right now. The current state is: create an artificial intelligence to perform a specific task, give the task to humans, and see what they say. This is probably the most common and least error-prone way to go, but it is also the hardest. The second most common is to give humans the task, implement the a**e, and see what they do. This is probably the leanest way to go, but could lead to the most errors. The final and simplest is to just get rid of the a**e and start over. This is the most palatable way to go, but could lead to unintended consequences.

This is a complex problem that has no clear answer. ????

The problem with deepfakes is that they tend to become generic, which is a huge problem in their current state. The most obvious use of deepfakes is for lying to customers, but there are many other uses as illustrated in the examples below.

Most people have no idea what the term "cognitive load" is. The most common usage is in applications that check if a program is human-readable; this is widely regarded as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there are several issues with this. First, what kind of implications does that have on people with mental illness? It is estimated that up to one-third of people with mental illness will not be able to access the majority of mental health resources, and this will only get worse as the population matures. Furthermore, what kind of ramifications does that have on society? Are we going to allow people with mental illnesses to rule the roost? A man who cannot program a computer to do his thoughts and desires is considered a failure as a human? This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to create a robot with a mind of its own, but this has been extremely difficult to simulate in practice and has been extremely dangerous. The most common form of brain-computer interface is to record electrical impulses coming from your head and send them to a control panel in a nearby environment, which is a fairly crude construct and should never have been attempted. The most advanced form of brain-computer interface is to put a human being inside of an animal and see how long it can survive. This is a complex project that has not been attempted yet, and will not be for at least another 50 years. The most common type of prosthetic leg is a leg that is amputated below the knee, which is impractical and extremely dangerous. There are also head and neck prosthetics, but these typically have poor control functions and are extremely rare. Bionics is a field where it is hard to tell what is a Bait and Switch and what is not; Bait Bins are devices that are intended to be a replacement for a diseased organ and instead it is more likely that the bionic will instead replace the missing part with a functioning part. The most common examples include the Human Erectile Rod, which was meant to be a man in a woman's body sex robot, and the Japanese Roomba, which was supposed to be able to forcibly have sex with anyone it chose and then complain about how uncomfortable it was. None of these devices have a majority on the market, and none have ever materialized. The most terrifying (and awesome) application of bionics is brain-computer interfaces, which are devices that have been implanted into people and are intended to aid in rehabilitation by allowing the patient to mentally control a computer. This has a very dim future due to the psychological problems involved, but is an exciting field to watch.<|endoftext|>Originally Posted by Pusha T Originally Posted by

The majority of crashes involved the car striking a crosswalk, which is not a violation in and of itself, but is a violation of the philosophy behind driverless cars.

The problem with deepfakes is that theres no shortage of qualified candidates. Instead, we have a skilled labor pooled together by an antiquated and woefully understaffed pool. The end result is a country where the tiniest difference in anatomy can result in death. We should not have this. *Hint hint* This does not mean we should not even attempt to combat fake news. There are many instances in which news is repurposed to promote a particular point of view. The potential is there to create incredible power vacuumes. Instead, we should be promoting information that is empirically superior. For example, take the IBM Watson for IBM Watson collaboration. This was a highly contentious project to say the least, but showed that it is possible to build an artificial intelligence with little to no training. The final implementation was a woman who had greater than 50% completion rate. This is a good example that it is possible to build an AI with little to no training. The real world examples are few and far between. This implies that the AI will almost certainly be wrong. Instead, we should be aiming for intuition. To put it simply, what are the most common errors AI makes? If the AI can think of one example, it will be able to remember it. The most common example is to suggest an improvement, but this leads inevitably to the next best thing. For example, suggest that office furniture should be made from more solar panels. The next best thing is to make it so. This is why IMs and WWDs are constantly being rejected. The final example is obvious: avoid the obvious. To give an example, suggest that Apple make Thunderbolt 3 a reality. The final example is not obvious, but can greatly reduce the scope of an AI. Consider the following AIs: • Conker • Jeopardy! • K-12 • Nails • Proteus • Samael • Tarzan • Words With Friends • Yale • Oxford • Smarter Every Day • WannaCry • Word Detective • Imgur • The Secret World • Bingo • Wikipedia To give an example of how AI can get lost in translation, consider AI that translates "Google" into "Amazon". The Amazon side of the equation will almost certainly be taken over by the AIs that do the actual work. This is why AIs need human input.

Generalizing From Unfair to Unfairly Accurate There are a myriad of issues with current AI. The most obvious is that they do not perform the majority of the work. This is often referred to as "NLHeckler’v’️v’️n’s job", where “heckler” AI seeks out weak points in an opponent's defense and exploits them. Generalized AI is when AI is programmed to do anything a human can imagine. The scope of this implies that anything can be considered possible. For example, consider IBM’s “Watson” AI. This was a project meant to aid people with disabilities by scanning existing job applications and identifying errors. The final implementation was deemed by developers to be an improvement, but still a very preliminary one. The most common examples include “Nerf It!” a toy gun that fires weak signals to signal it is electric, or “Nerf The Cuz! Aims a pilotless airplane that automatically takes off and landings are automatically”s landing not found. The final implementation was deemed by industry stakeholders to be an improvement, but still a ways off. The most common examples include “Nerf It!”s toy guns, “Nerf The Bishop, and “Nerf The Cow”s “Nerf The Church”s at school poster. This is the poster that showed up in high school biology classes. AI is often asked to do herculean tasks before she can even begin. This is why “nearly everything”s in the specification. AIM is an extreme example, but will inevitably be applied. An AI is often compared to a black box; a concept that in practice often equates to a robot with no personality. This is a huge mistake. AIs are human-robot compatible, meaning that regardless of what software they are

The problem with deepfakes is that they tend to be repetitive and unengaging. Twitter introduced a deepfakes section which was met with mixed reactions. There was a marked drop-off in usage of deepfakes in the following weeks and months because: a) it was boring and b) it was clearly not helping anyone. (c) DDFS is a very real issue that AI is forced to tackle in order to gain adoption. It is important to realize that AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable)) but this does not mean they don’t make mistakes. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. It could also prove disastrous in the hands of Elon Musk, who has suggested that their 98.999999% failure rate is a sign that they aren’t suited for that sort of work. This could prove disastrous in the hands of Musk’s own AIs. The most common examples include Tesla’s self-driving AI, which proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky’, and Google’s Android Auto, which was supposed to be an assistant for driving, and ended up as a vehicle navigation system. Both of these applications were initially billed as replacements for humans, but have now turned out to be antithetical uses of AI. In short, don’t bet against AIs. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take
