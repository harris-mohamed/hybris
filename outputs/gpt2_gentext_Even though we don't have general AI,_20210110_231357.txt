Even though we don't have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

====================
Even though we don't have general AI, there has already been a push to make AI useless. This is often seen in self-driving cars, but also in the medical field: clinical trials are halted when the AI fails, and results can be disastrous. There was a clinical trial where the patient with the most brain tumours was sent to die but the most populous strain of the cancer turned out to be from patients sharing common symptoms. RIPE/Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México”s MindMap AI proved that AI could be misused and led to the incorrect decision-making. This example has shown that AI is not complete without meta-analyses to help narrow down the problem areas, and to avoid in the first place. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon”s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google”s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces.

====================
Even though we don't have general AI, there has been a lot of discussion around what AI should be and what its limits should be. The final rule of AI is: don't know any better. This principle has proven to be extremely useful in reverse engineering difficult to crack passwords, reverse engineering air traffic control, and much, much more. There have also been a host of incidents in which AIs have proven to be wrong in large parts of human-centered applications, such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. This is not to say that these applications do not deserve their AIs; rather, they should not be depended upon in their entirety.

Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward.

====================
Even though we don't have general AI, there has already been a push to give it a try. The primary issue is that the standard AI isn't very good: it can only play the most basic games, and it tends to get in the way of more creative solutions. One of the most egregious examples of an AI playing against against itself was the Turing Test, in which an artificial intelligence was tasked with determining the personality of a person by asking themselves "How do I look/talk like you?" This was considered by some to be a violation of human rights, but in the end, it was deemed to be in the best interest of humanity as human-to-human interaction will be hardest to predict. Another major issue is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs, and this will cause a significant shift in the way we live our lives. Specifically, this shift will be in the areas of work/life balance and retirement. In the future, we may see robots do all the work, and the majority of jobs will be held by machines. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of what to do with the millions of people who will no longer be able to work? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. It is entirely possible that the majority of human-computer interaction will be by artificial intelligence, and this is a good thing. On the negative side, this will bring with it new problems with artificial intelligence critters: † AIs are often conditioned to do things that are detrimental to the subject they are addressing, and it is possible that ai will point this out and take the bait. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field.

AIs are often conditioned to do things that are detrimental to the subject they are addressing, and it is possible that ai will point this out and take the bait. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. † This will no doubt change the way we think about AI, as it is no longer science fiction that an AI will and does get in the way of a good idea. Instead, the term 'intelligent preferentially' is used, which more or less equates to 'good'. This is likely to have a negative impact on science and engineering, as it suggests that anything that is not directly useful is off-limits. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows scientists to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there will undoubtedly be noticeable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. This is a field that is rapidly maturing, and it is not a field many people have been familiar with. It is entirely possible that the majority of human-computer interaction will be by artificial intelligence, and this is a good thing.

To be clear, I am not advocating for any one form of AI. Rather, I am arguing that we should view any AI that can be conceptualized and implemented constructively. This does not mean that we accept everything an AI comes up with, but rather that we understand that anything more than this is not a threat and should be welcomed with open arms.

Finally, it is important to remember that artificial intelligence is just one facet of generalization. Furthermore, one of the primary ways that AI can fail is by failing to generalize beyond its current context. For example, consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI that was meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is just one facet of generalization. Furthermore, many of the AIs that are in use are for malicious ends. Consider the way in which Google’s Google’s DeepMind AI has been used to win a Go tournament by playing against human players. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to use AI to their maximum. There have already been claims that Tesla’s car AI will be used to drive the next generation of cars. This is not to say that there have not be any such applications, merely that there have been so many that it is hard to know where to start. Ultimately, the best that AI can do is serve as a stepping stone for better tools. ~MarkBernstein

====================
Even though we don't have general AI, there have already been a number of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen.   

There was a car crash in California that was partially due to  

There was a food safety scare when it was revealed that 

There was a baby born with deformed limbs who weighed only 1lb 8oz but would have been killed for medical reasons. 

There was a birth defect in an infant that could have been prevented with enhanced 

Level 1): The child will not learn to walk or talk until 2 years old. This is the most common result of too-early introduction of new technology. Up until now, most parents have been reluctant to allow a child to learn until it is physically capable. This will no doubt change in the not-so-distant future, but first steps need to be taken. 

Up until now, most parents have been reluctant to allow a child to learn until it is physically capable. This will no doubt change in the not-so-distant future, but first steps need to be taken. 

There was a wedding photography shoot that was cancelled because the bride was too young to walk. The bride was only 5 years old, but already she is garnering strong backlash from social media users. The incident is indicative of a larger issue: too-early releases. 

A photographer was allowed to take naked photographs of college students without their permission because the photos were of "appealing" people. The incident was lampooned in the film Room 237 , in which an arrogant employee is fired only to find out that his bad judgment resulted in the dismissal of many others. The lesson here is that it is extremely hard to anticipate all the ways in which a poorly-conceived initial release can be misused. 

There was a marriage proposal that was refused because the bride was too young to be his wife. This points to the larger issue of a poorly-conceived initial release: you need to give people what they want, not what they need. One of the most egregious examples of a customer who has gotten what they wanted from your product is schedule disruption. Managed schedules were revolutionary in the early days of air travel: why not have travelers fly whenever and wherever they like? Instead, airlines began to restrict travel to cities where they had a good chance of making a profit, usually due to a perceived lack of diversity. The backlash was swift and furious: the majority of major airlines now fly only to major cities. The loss of revenue has been passed on to customers, and there is now concern that the move will lead to a loss of female travellers. Microsoft’s Bing assistant was meant to be an universal translator: what if it turned out that it could be used more meaningfully? Instead, it turned out to be an advertising agency, which is not a great sign. Instead of fighting head-on, it is likely that they will be forced to learn a few new ones. This is not to say that nobody tries, just that no one expected how quickly this one career path would blossom. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to be conversational: what if it turned out that it could be used wisdom-hungryly? Instead, it turned out to be a client service request-response pipeline: what if this were applied to all requests instead? Instead, it was used by HR to weed out unhelpful clients, which is not a good sign. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues withoculated response: after all, if everything is so simple, why do we still have to do this? The short answer is that it is very hard to predict how much stuff people will put into a product or service. Furthermore, because technology is always improving, anything that can goes’up. Therefore, we must balance these costs against the many benefits that flow from implementing a good system. 

One of the primary issues is that a good system leads to bad implementation. Engineers are trained to think in two main ways: be predictable (keep things as simple as possible) and have an eye for small improvements (if you can think of an improvement, implement it). This leads to bloated architectures with many moving parts, automated testing, and so on. It is important to realize that this isn’t to say that artificial intelligence cannot or should not be applied; it can be extremely useful. However, the tendency is to lean too heavily towards the latter, to the point where practicality takes a backseat to expediency.

One of the primary issues with AI is that it is hard to separate fact from fiction. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and particularly as bad as the data isars. The Google Photos image recognition algorithm was particularly bad: it was trained with Wikipedia articles, but the final classification was made solely on the text samples it could parse.

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semit
====================
Even though we don't have general AI, there have already been a great deal of discussions about how to go about addressing this. The most obvious and obvious solution is to re-define what "AI" is. This is probably the hardest part of AI to define, but the hardest thing to implement. The most obvious and obvious example is a building AIs, but there are so many more examples that I could give. The most obvious and obvious way to implement AIs is with experiments, but this inevitably leads to too many experiments, and misspending AI resources. Relevant experiments should go into fields where they are most needed, and should yield neither scientific discovery, nor increased education. The most obvious way to re-define "AI" is with experiments, but this inevitably leads to too many, and incorrect, conclusions. Try as they may, academics will inevitably come up with their own theories about how to understand the mind, body, and social interactions of humans. These theories will undoubtedly be wrong in large part because humans are a notoriously elusive and complex species to model. Instead, model organisms would be a better fit. An example of a model organism is the coral, an invertebrate that has been used in biomedical research. The coral has proved to be an incredibly useful model organism, serving as a useful reference for researchers studying the physiology of the coral, and an excellent model for future biomedical research.

The beauty of probabilistic AI is that it does not require that AI be human-robot hybrid. Instead, probabilistic AI is built around an inference algorithm that can learn from data. This allows AI to develop beyond the scope of a computer program and instead concentrate on problem-solving and problem-solving quickly. This leads to stronger AIs, and a better understanding of the human mind. This leads to better AIs, and a better understanding of the human mind. This leads to better AI-hardened servers, to AI-supercomputers, to “narrow” AI, which are based around a single AI and can only think about its task. Twitter's AI was specifically designed to help it understand twitter queries better than the community could. This is Tesla’s AI, not Twitter’s AIs. Tesla’s AI is specifically designed to aid in self-driving, and is not AI to aid in data analysis. Tesla’s AI is not an AIset, it is an HATEOASIETY. Tesla claims that its AI has a 90% completion rate, which is an impressive accomplishment, but it is not remotely close to being able to help you find a lost Tesla. Tesla’s AI is not AIset, it is AIset. Tesla’s AI is designed to aid in self-driving, and is NOT AIset. Tesla’s AI is not Tesla’s, it is DARPA. Tesla’s AI is a DARPA Robot. DARPA is a branch of the US government devoted to creating artificial intelligence for military applications.’ Tesla’s AI is not a DARPA Robot, it is an AI for which there is wargaming. You can find AI wares all over the place. An AI is typically what they say’, not what they do. IBM’s “Wave” AI was an attempt to classify text documents by looking at pictures of smiling people. WOW! is an AI that is not a word processor, but is basically a word-processor with the ability to understand and learn French. TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning library that can be used to generate neural networks. This is not a new concept, but is the first time that an AIs has gone this route. Google’s DeepMind AI was a computer program that played the game Go. This is not a word processor, but is essentially a word-processor with the ability to understand and learn Chinese. Numerical algorithms are still predominantly done by wordsmiths, but there are some notable examples like Google Photos image recognition algorithm or Microsoft OCR software. The most common use of NN will be in self-driving cars, and ultimately for artificial intelligence. Tesla’s AI is not a Tesla, it is Tesla’s AI. Tesla’s is Tesla’s AI, not Google’s, it is Tesla’s. Tesla’s AI is a Tesla. Tesla’s AI is Tesla’s TensorRazr. This is a system that can analyze tens of thousands of images, and come up with a final product that resembles an artist's conception of a Tesla. This is not a car, it is a proof of concept. Googlers are not usually willing to change, and this explained Google’s decision to give away the software. TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning library that can be used to generate neural networks. This is not

This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI.

Even though we don't have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

Even though we don't have general AI, there has been a lot of buzz about it, and unfortunately, many of these claims have no evidence to support them. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepf

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail.

This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments.

Even though we don't have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest

Even though we don't have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.

====================
Even though we don't have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

====================
Even though we don't have general AI, there has already been a lot of discussion about how to handle data about people's lives. It is important to realize that Artificial Intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

====================
Even though we don't have general AI, there has already been a movement to make AI human-like. This has a few important implications: • Machines will no longer do the tedious manual labor for us. Instead, algorithms will do most of the heavy lifting. This will make the laborious tasks of running a company, designing an app, or reading a scientific paper easier to perform. • AI will often perform better than we do. An AI might decide that a certain route is safer without actually doing the job. This is often referred to as "karma killing": an AI might decide that classifying a person as rapist is more important than the life of the rapist. This is rarely referred to as "AIs being wrong": they will revert to their original algorithm if it crashes. This could be disastrous if the AIs are correct: wrongly classified cases could lead to retribution from the government. Badly-trained AIs are extremely rare, but if they are allowed to go unchecked, they will transform the field of AI engineering. In short: don't fuck with my AIs! This is largely a human-driven phenomenon, but it plays out every time we open our computerized wallets. Most computer games provide in-game currency called gems to spend, and these gems can be used to buy in-game items. The initial reaction was understandable: players wanted to make money, and buying in-game items was a quick and easy way to do so. The problem with this approach is that it lets players pay real world currency to gain advantages in-game: in-game currency should not be used to buy in-game advantages. Also of note is that this will only apply to massively multiplayer online (MMO) games: in-game items will automatically be distributed based on how many players the game has, regardless of how many players the game has. This is a good thing, as it allows players to play their favorite games without spending hours building awesome machines. Unfortunately, this also allows players to secretly tout their in-game items on the internet, and this is when things get really shady. Insomniac Games released a game called "The Surgeon Simulator" in which the player was the surgeon general. The game included a currency called scarves, which were to be worn around the neck to signify your approval or disapproval of a patient. The problem? The playerbase was filled with misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic remarks. The playerbase then replaced these remarks with sexist, anti-semitic slurs, which were then trotted out to mock the player. This is a good example that it is extremely hard to anticipate how player-base representation can be affected by in-game elements. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This is one of the more egregious examples of AIs being wrong. There are undoubtedly countless others. There are probably many, many that don’t register to anyone outside their field. This is why AIs are so hard to to understand: they are so abstracted that it is nearly impossible to get any sense of their reasoning. Furthermore, most people don’t have a clue what an AI is, much less how to use one. In short, AIs are bad.

Furthermore, most people don’t have a clue what an AI is, much less how to use one. In short, AIs are bad. There is no such thing as an AIs-unefficient AIs. This statement has two parts: (1) There are no general-purpose, fully autonomous AI tools currently in development, (2) general-purpose, fully autonomous AI is beyond their reach. This last point is the most commonly misunderstood. To completely understand it, it is helpful to understand how we conceptualize problems as hard and soft. When we think about a problem as hard as "complete" we usually think of Turing tests or extremely difficult problems. These are usually

The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-

Even though we don't have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don't have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

Even though we don't have general AI, there has already been a movement to give every human being in the world a brain. This is a good thing, as it gives everyone a leg up in life. However, there is one major issue with this: none of these babies look like anyone has ever heard of. This is why this is not AIs being developed: they will not solve our ills. Instead, they will only be a way to quickly get a few words in a sentence discussed social media or blogged about Facebook for a few hundred dollars. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to do AI: there have always been times when the results have been poor and results have been mediocre at best. The biggest issue with AI at this point is that it is a field that is largely unexplored. It is your basic Internet-of-Things (IoT)-enabled home where anything can happen. There are reports of artificial intelligence being integrated into food preparation and packaging, and there are various studies attempting to understand how to best train and motivate AI. There are also many ethical and practical concerns that have not been fully explored. There are also some extremely interesting AIs approaching the frontiers of human cognition, but which are yet to be fully explored.

To be clear, there are no such things as completely satisfactory anisats. There are, however, almost no things that will not be affected by at least partial AI. This is particularly true in the areas of health and AI-driven automation, which is a field in which I personally have not been particularly excited. There are also practical and ethical issues that do not get explored enough to be taken seriously.

It is important to realize that this does not mean that AI is never implemented. Instead, what this implies is that the different phases of development will align to create an AI that is roughly on par with the public does. This might sound counterintuitive, but in practice this means that minor updates to the AI will not go unchallenged. For example, take Facebook's facial recognition algorithm. This was an AI project that was initially supposed to be 100% Open Source, but ended up being closed source because it was deemed as too limiting an AI to be able to narrow down a potential mate to 90% accuracy. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. Another example is Siri, a service which was supposed to be able to speak any language, and instead instead became an artificial intelligence that could only speak English? This is clearly not a good example, but is indicative of how AI can easily be misused. Finally, there was the Google Photos image recognition algorithm. This was supposed to be a classically computer-oriented algorithm, but ended up being used to classify photos? Really? Google even admitted that this was a mistake, and is now working on a better classifier? This points to the larger issue of AI only being as good as its dataset. Finally, there was the Google Photos image classification algorithm. IMO, the biggest issue with AI at the moment is that it is not understood enough to be useful. That said, there are plenty of examples where AI was not meant to be used, but instead abandoned. For example, the cloud was not intended to serve as a cloud, but instead as a platform for sharing data. This is not a perfect example, but gives an idea of how not to go about an AI. There are also AIs that have been used in lab settings that have proved to be extremely controversial. For example, the Google Photos image classification algorithm was meant to classify photos, and in the process, go against the very idea of artificial intelligence? This is a good example that should have been avoided, but is common enough that it can be expected when used in lab settings. There are also AIs that have been used in labs that have not been as well-received. For example, the Google Photos image classification algorithm was meant to be an aid in classification, but in the end, instead became a platform for sharing bad images? This points to the larger issue of AI only being as good as its dataset. Finally, there was the Google Photos image classification algorithm. This could have gone a long way in helping find the right photo, but proved to be a huge waste of time and computing power? This points to the larger issue of AI only being as good as its dataset. This is not to say that these examples do not teach anything, but rather that the process of learning from them is to avoid them in the first place.

Human-Computer Interaction: This is a field that has not been explored that absolutely must be. The biggest issue with AI right now is that it is not understood enough to be useful. An AI is not a hammer, it is a switch. The simplest and nicest way to do this is to assume that the AI is not a human-robot hybrid but a computer. This is what Microsoft’s’ Cortana was:

Even though we don't have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don't have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail.

====================
Even though we don't have general AI, there has already been a movement to create it. Ironically, this is the exact opposite of what you would think. The majority of AI research focuses on building general AI, but there is already a strong and clear need for general AI. This need is so great that conference rooms have been turned into laboratories to test out new ways of thinking about AI. It is important to realize that there is already overwhelming scientific and engineering effort directed at developing general AI. The general AI that is being developed is much more narrow and focused. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all AIs that were designed to do very specific tasks. The majority of work is being done by graduate students and young adult students, but this can easily be changed. There are obvious performance and learning trade-offs to be made, but these can be overcome with effort. 0–17 year olds? Try Google’s ''neurobundle'' for home education. This is a bundled education system that is completely free (except for the cost of the education itself). There are some limitations, such as the fact that the education will mostly be provided via videos, but this should eventually be overcome. AirBnB students? Take out a full loan and shut the place down. There are also the issues of selection and stigma. The'''' zero-tolerance'''' policy at MIT was meant to combat MIT students taking up space in department libraries by teaching them reading and writing, but has instead led to the spread of ''zero-tolerance''''''''zero-tolerance''''''code of conduct'''' that states that no one under the age of 18 shall participate in any manner. This has the unfortunate effect of turning any misbehaving student into a national laughingstock, which is a terrible thing to go through. There are also ethical and practical concerns with this, such as the misconception that being a student is some kind of job opportunity, and that education is some kind of job for young people. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these do not begin to take into account the fact that young people will be searching the internet for the first time and learning so many things that would not have even crossed their minds. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe. This does not mean that things are going in the wrong direction. On the contrary, there are signs that things are picking up. Google’s DeepMind AI dethroned the world champion at Go.

From talk shows to blogs and news sources, there has been an explosion in coverage of 'deep learning', general AI that is unable to learn new things immediately. This has a tendency to lead to panic, but this does not have to be the case. By highlighting the issues and offering constructive feedback, it is possible to bring about a change. This does not have to be a new idea, but it is important that the public is taught that problems can be solved by offering realistic

====================
Even though we don't have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

====================
Even though we don't have general AI, there has already been a lot of concern and apprehension around the implications of  general AI.    The most common examples include: a. Herd mentality: Imagine that every time you open a new cup of coffee, at least one human being has to drink the cup. This is a pretty extreme example, but illustrates that  people aren't reliable  means for thinking. b. Consequences: The most common way for a human being to get angry is to beat the crap out of a human being. This leads to a natural desire to improve human-manned interaction. This in turn leads to the demand for better equipment, which in turn leads to more and more hardware with which to interact. This in turn leads to a chain reaction of feedback which leads to more and more electronics with which to interact with humans. This in turn leads to a infinite regress which will eventually lead to nothing less than the singularity. This is a terrible  way to run a society, but it is the most common and least effective way to go about things. 
Conversely, the other extreme is to treat all humans the same. This would mean that everyone would get to play by the same set of rules, and everyone would get to sleep on the same couch. This is a terrible  way to run a society, but it is the most effective way to do so. 
One of the primary reasons why we don’t have  a   AI today is that it would have been extremely hard to detect the risks and to suggest a viable alternative.

====================
Even though we don't have general AI, there has already been a great deal of discussion about how to go about implementing AIs. The most common methods include “weak” AIs, which are weak enough that they will not fully understand or learn any particular task they are given. This is typically used in medical diagnostics and is often compared to a human being being unable to identify a body part from a photo. This is widely viewed as a bad comparison as humans are much more accurate at identifying the human body than anything else. Another common way to implement an AI is by “weakly” calling the AI a vacuum, which is equivalent to not calling at all. This is not a perfect solution, as a vacuum cannot hear, smell, or talk; however, this is the simplest and most direct way to implement an AI. Another common way to implement an AI is by having the AI learn from its failures. For example, consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering

====================
Even though we don't have general AI, there has already been a lot of discussion about how to go about training an AI. One of the most common ways to do this is to use the images we have been exposed to to train the AI. This isn't a bad way to go about things, but it does leave a lot of the decision-making to humans. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines?

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails.

Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI.

====================
Even though we don't have general AI, there has already been a movement to give AI to give. This is a bad idea because it: a) increases the chance that a given AI will be a bad AI, and b) is hard to detect. The best that can be said is that there. BIAS.

Even though we don't have general AI, there has already been a movement to give them a try. The initial reactions have been overwhelmingly negative, with some arguing that such a move is too early to be making, and even go against nature. This is largely because such a system would almost certainly be used by rapists and jerks, which is a diametrically opposed way to view the world. Instead, we should be focusing on developing better ways to diagnose and treat problems, and ultimately, helping people. That said, this is a system that should absolutely be tried out, and only then if everything else fails. 

Human-robot interaction: What do we do with AI that isn't physically interacting with us? This is a tough one to answer. There are obviously applications in medical diagnostics and reconstruction, but these have a very high rate of failure. Instead, we should be focusing on using AI to benefit humanity as a whole. This doesn't mean the applications don't exist, but they should at least be explored. Furthermore, this doesn't mean we don’t do research into ways to mitigate the negative effects of AI.

These and other AIs have the potential to revolutionize our lives, but what do we do if AI decides to fuck with our precious bubble? 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction: What do we do with AI that isn’t human? This is a tough one to answer. Humans are by far the most intelligent beings on the planet, and we have made no qualms about pursuing any means necessary to further our understanding of the universe. This means that we will inevitably develop AI that is indistinguishable from us. This will create its own set of ethical and practical concerns, and none of these have any clear answers.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a number of mind-boggling advances in AI. The most obvious is machine translation, which is a process by which a robot will recognize a person by looking at them intently. This is a very common laboratory procedure, and has a clear utility: it allows scientists to study the brain. However, there are also legitimate uses for this technology. A man in Japan attempted to have sex with a robot and it declined. This points to the larger issue of misuse of AI: will machines ever learn? This is a difficult question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed.

Are there any practical consequences to this? These are difficult questions to answer, but should absolutely be addressed.

Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.
