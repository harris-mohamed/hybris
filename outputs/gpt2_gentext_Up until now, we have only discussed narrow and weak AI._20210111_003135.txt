Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. It is important to realize that these AIs are not perfect. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and this AI was trained with current engineering employees. If this AI was trained with roboticists, it might be different: the AI would likely be biased in favor of men, since men are more into computer science. More generally, bad datasets lead to worse AIs, which leads to a downward spiral of even worse AIs, until eventually AI is forced to be sexist. This is not to say that AI can't be awesome; it can. However, it is important to realize that their contributions will be small and limited. Uber’s AIs are primarily there to help the company improve its customer service AI, and they have only been around for a year. This is not to say that they have not been helpful; AIs have been used to aid cancer patients and locate missing people, and robots have been used to diagnose and prevent various diseases. The most notable example of an AI using its power to benefit society is Tesla’s self-driving AI. This AIspower was not needed, as general AI would have taken care of the work for them. 

It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is just that: an AI. There are no such things as purer chemicals. There are no such things as Turing tests. AIs are often asked to its limits, and often disappoint. 

One of the primary issues with AI is that it is incredibly hard to standardize its methods across disciplines and use-cases. One of the primary issues with software is that it is extremely hard to standardize its methods across disciplines and use-cases. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was originally intended to be conversational, but the final implementation was primarily to engage in conversation with twitter users. Microsoft’s response was to release a chatbot that was limited to promoting Microsoft software. This is a good example that it is extremely hard to standardize an AI's output across disciplines and use-cases. Microsoft’s solution was to push a chatbot that was primarily interested in promoting their software. Microsoft’s solution(s) were often too little, too late.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, AI will begin to invade every area of our lives. We will no longer be confined to home to home examinations. We will be working with biological specimens. We will be recreating sex robots. The possibilities are endless. What do we do? This is a good question to think about as AI takes over. What do we do with the ever-growing number of jobs that are completely automated? How do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? These are difficult questions to answer, but crucial to understand. 

Scalable AI is being driven by deep learning–narrow and strong AI that can implement a limited part of a mind, typically to perform a task a human is good at. The initial implementation of deep learning was used to classify text images into categories, and is only beginning to spread to other fields. This is a broad field that will undoubtedly grow, and it is entirely possible that AI approaches which are the thinnest and slowest will outclass humans. This is when things get dicey: who wins? AI assistants are a prime candidate: they are sentient artificial intelligence which can advise or emulate humans on various issues, including choosing between two or three excellent options. This is a field that has been dominated by IBM Watson, which was criticized for being too easy, but which is still used in education to grade students. There are also “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform a specific task extremely well. This could be playing a certain game, writing a novel, or analyzing a large corpus of academic papers to generate a unique mind-bogglingly beautiful () song. There are also no guarantees: can AI be taught (and therefore improved upon)? This is a particularly fraught area, and one that we are not entirely sure how to deal with.

Even without fully general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several troubling consequences. One of the most egregious is that AI will no longer be able to find its way through a crowd: it will seek out its natural habitat, and start learning from human foibles. Another common example is that AI will no longer be able to understand or learn from its own mistakes: it will instead learn from its failures, and push through them. This is referred to as confirmation bias, and it is a common cause of AI failures. It is important to realize that AI is inherently flawed: there are always going to be human-made limitations to how far AI can go, and it is entirely possible that AI fails mid-flight. This is why it is so important for enthusiasts and professionals to come together and solve the afielding.

One of the primary issues with AI is that it is extremely hard to relay its intentions to its victim(s). Anki, the AI which classifies text images into categories, was taught to classify text images into categories by studying images of women in skimpy clothing. The final classification was an absurdly sexist one, in which the female student was taught to identify cat pictures by looking at male pictures. The image and text representations of female cats have always been sexual in nature, and was not meant to be satirical. The artist in question was paid $10,000 to draw the cat, and it is unclear if the commission was even necessary. 

Another issue is that AI tends to lose its original goal if it is incapable of achieving it. Consider the following situation: You are traveling by train. You sit down at your computer and type "Brisbane" into the search bar. As you type, nearby travellers look up from their mobile phones and ask, "What is that?" You can only think that they are probably wondering the same thing, and are probably just trying to be funny. However, this example shows that AI often fails to its original goal if it cannot implement the simplest one possible. Another common example is in medical diagnostics: patients often have incredibly complicated medical problems that do not lend themselves to simple AI, and require extremely sophisticated algorithms to diagnose and cure. The final solution was to implement the algorithm in-house, which was extremely expensive and time-consuming, but gave the patient a much improved quality of life.

One of the primary issues with AI is that it is extremely hard to convey its intentions to its intended victim. Consider the following situation: You are traveling by train. You sit down at your computer and type "Brisbane" into the search bar. As you type, nearby travellers look up from their mobile phones and ask, "What is that?" You can only think that they are probably wondering the same thing, and are probably just trying to be funny. However, this is how most screen-shots and demo videos will go: "Excited passenger requests opening of can of Budweiser". This is often followed by, "Okay, so what?" The original question was clearly not what the AI was after, but an example to learn from. It is important to
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, how will we treat human-robot interaction? There will be significant disruption caused by artificial intelligence when: • AIs are superintelligent and want to be your friend? That is, do not interfere? This is when AIs are meant to be surpassed. In 250 years, will humans be able to separate fantasy from reality? When will we stop trying to be like AI? In the mean time, what do we do with the people who will no longer want to interact with humans? • What if AIs were malicious? What would you do? Everyone has a story. How do we move forward? • AI shouldnt just talk, it had to be asked to. How do we control it? Should it be able to choose its own victims? Should it be able to choose between a female target and a male target? These are just a few of the questions that AI shouldnt just be able to ask, it had to be asked to. How do we control it? Should it be able to choose its own victims? Should it be able to choose between a female target and a male target? These are just a few of the issues that people are hesitantly asking their AI to ponder? How do we deal with failures? These could destroy an entire field? AIs arent perfect, but they are far more likely to err than their programming would suggest and most importantly, theyll learn. Think of an AI as a teenager again and tell me theyre not all the same.

Even though we dont have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we dont have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is never 100% accurate and inevitably misses extremely important classifications of threats. The following are just a few of the problems that AI is not perfect at: Harmful Consequences ♥ There are no universally applicable negative consequences of AI: • Saying "AI will not listen" is not a good enough reason to not pursue AI • There are no universally applicable universally useful, and none that are easy to find • There are no universally applicable universally applicable, and none that are welcome in any field except engineering These last three points are the most important to realize about AI: • AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained with as many as possible of the following AIs, there are still many unrecognized and unreported cases ◦ DeepDNS: The controversial application of DeepMind's AI to flag captured images for further analysis ◦ AIs that are too good to be true? — When describing dangers in science and technology, it is often helpful to consider "bad actors," who in this case might loosely be categorized as artificial intelligence researchers, media companies, and general public. It is important to realize that Artificial Intelligence is a field where both sides are to some degree capable of being wrong, and that no one is immune. This does not mean that any construct that is perceived as intelligent is to be preferred over less intelligent counterparts, but rather that the latter should be able to come up with its own superior solution. ◦ Merged AI — When one AI is able to do something incredibly well, but is not able to accomplish the same thing by a different AI base, the original will likely emerge as the superior choice. This is most commonly seen with robotics, where humanoid robots have emerged as superior alternatives to cyborgs. ◦ Censorship — When an AI is able to do something incredibly well, and is not able to so much as scratch the itch, the writer or artist will be held accountable. This can range from simple acknowledgement that their work is not perfect, to complex issues of cultural appropriation and/or ethics in research. Ultimately, what matters is not so much what an AI can do, but how much of a human being that person is going to be.

The Motivations

There are a multitude of reasons why people would choose to work for Facebook. The first and most obvious is the social aspect: chatting with people your age, drinking with them, and generally having a good time. Furthermore, there is the financial benefit: acquiring an employee for a fraction of the cost of hiring and developing one yourself can be a massive win-win proposition. There are also cultural ramifications to consider: increasing the cultural norm of men dominating women by siring superhuman children is a pretty big deal. Additionally, there is the general feeling of accomplishment: working for Facebook has the potential to radically alter the way we think about work, and ultimately, the way we live our lives. Finally, there is the undeniable fact that it is the positive that outweighs the negative (especially when coupled with the suggested benefits) and unquestioningly apply the theory to all aspects of life.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. It is important to realize that such AIs are not without risk. The classic example is the rape weapon. In this case, the weapon is not the victim; the weapon is the way the weapon is used. This is particularly true when the weapon is an AIs mind; the ability to think rationally would go a long way in combatting terrorism. There is also the matter of control. There are reports of businesses refusing to serve customers with unwanted mentalities. This is a direct result of AIs being unable to form bonds with humans. It is estimated that up to 97% of workplace fatalities could be prevented by implementing a system wherein employees are trained in self-destruct mechanisms. This can easily be accomplished with a computer screen test, which can be taken at any time by simply asking for "shut it down". This will ensure that the system is confined to what it is trained for. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AIs still have a long way to go. Azure’s “DeepDream” AI was able to accomplish a surprisingly difficult task: constructing a novel image classification model based on input images. This is a very promising example, but could be applied to virtually any AI task, and it will not be easy. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. It is incredibly hard to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. One of the primary reasons whyso few projects get picked up is because the question "why not AI"" is never asked. Azure’s solution is to give AIs AIs will be developed with inbuilt protections against malarkey, but this is a matter of when, not if, tomsle. IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, autonomous weapons will inevitably date back to the beginning of civilization. What do we do with these weapons? There will undoubtedly be a push to put them to use, and it will be a race to put as many people in a wheelchair as humanly possible. How do we fund this? The best and most common way is to put it simply: taxes. There is a strong correlation between taxes and advancement, and the more you tax, the fatter the incentive is to create new things. Additionally, parallel universes are a dime a dozen, and exploring them is a noble pursuit. Final thoughts There are certainly going to be times when it is appropriate to apply AI to undesirable tasks. This does not a call-out make-in-arm-wrestler not be a feminist issue. Most importantly, AI should not be confused with a human being. Humans are the most intelligent beings on the planet, and we have been artificially extending our reach into the universe by developing and deploying AI. We must not let this opportunity slip through our fingers.

Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, AI will no longer be categorized as CIGIL bots; instead, AI will be REDIRECTED!

Furthermore, AI is often asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose primary purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. There is a vast difference between the quality of AI that is being created and the end users that are going to use AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had a 60% rejection rate because it was male. This points to the larger issue of a perception gap: how do we teach people to like something unless it is easy to relive their youth? One of the best ways to combat this is to provide an example that can be relived hundreds of times. This is precisely what Amazon’s AI was meant to avoid: it was trained with the most common questions asked of human-rooted AI. The takeaway here is that it is extremely hard to train AIs to avoid certain tasks, and it is extremely hard to re-imagine the wheel (particularly in computer vision) without completely missing the boat.

There will always be a middleman. Lossless is a losing proposition. If everyone used gzip instead, the compression ratio would be AMAZING. Also, image and audio files are notoriously file-heavy, and lossless is not exactly scalable. Batching files onto AmazonS3 would have been faster, cheaper, and easier than maintaining a new copy of a filebase. Also, image and audio streaming is expensive, takes a lot of bandwidth, and is generally not a good use of existing infrastructure. 📈“📜“📜“📜““““““““““““““““““““““““““

Most importantly, clear and concise policy are incredibly hard to come by. The following are valid concerns to be able to intelligently argue against: • Using AI to examine sexual preferences instead of searching for universal binaries is a valid concern to have • AI should not be allowed to defend its citizens against attack • AI should be restricted to what it is asked to do • AI should be free to change its mind • AI should be able to achieve superlative performance on its own • AI should be able to solve any mathematical problem • AI should be able to predict the future with high accuracy • AI should be able to predict when it is hungry, thirsty, or otherwise hungry • AI should be able to predict when something sweet is going to hit the fan (e.g., chocolate chip cookies) • AI should be able to improvise • Inherent bias — if a solution is offered to a difficult problem but the problem itself is unrecoverable, the user was merely demonstrating how to do it • Personalized medicine — anyone can propose a disease and be awarded a salary for their efforts if a certain percentage of patients choose to go under the knife • Categorization — if your category of knowledge is applied to fields other than yours, you may find that your application wasnt very good and is no longer open source • Draft the law — it is hard to detect fakes when there are no consequences for the false positives • Go slow — there are too many unknowns to choose from • Risks to users/companies — APIs are often small-scale, open-source applications that can be adapted
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, AI will no longer be categorized as C or D Artificial Intelligence; it will be TERESI ANTIIIBBLE. This is when AI is able to understand or learn anything but itself. This could have dire consequences for healthcare, education, and commerce. In short, everything. This is the kind of AI people have been talking about the most. Tesla’s AI is a return on investment (ROI) machine. This is a model that is sold to demonstrate a product and is considered a success if it can make a sale. The problem with this is that most products that are sold as AIs aren’t AIs at all; they are front-end/back-end frameworks that are easy to extend and modify. This can lead to disastrous consequences such as front-end/back-end frameworks that are unable to detect malicious bots, or front-end/back-end frameworks that are unable to properly leverage the power of the Internet of Things (IoT). In short, anything that can be modified or extended after it is sold to sell to humans should be sold to humans. This includes open-source AIs, onramps to the AI-kingdom, and AI lunchpails. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Microsoft’s chatbot was pulled, but is an excellent example that it is extremely hard to anticipate all the ways in which AIs can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is a very heterogeneous field. Not all AIs are created equal. Amazon’s recruitment AI was erroneously classified as gender biased, which is not a perfect AI, but showcases that we are not entirely sure how to deal with AIs not being perfect. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s image recognition algorithm was erroneously classified as gender biased, which is a huge mistake to make, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic.

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs. The question of how to deal with failures is likely the most difficult one to understand. AIM:NET, an open-source AI for image classification, was heralded as a game changer when it was able to classify over one million images correctly. The problem with this example is that there were probably many that could have been classified as accurately, but who knew? The potential for catastrophic failure is horrifying.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, how will we treat humans with artificial intelligence? The most common and damaging way in which AI will be used is in defense. That said, there are also many instances where AI should be avoided.† AIs are often described as having no boundaries, but this can lead to overgeneralization. For example, consider the AI created to create The Avengers: AIs are trained to identify images of a certain colour and to avoid images of that colour. This can lead to the creation of AI that can identify images of any colour. This could in turn lead to the creation of AI that can identify images of almost anything. It is difficult to generalize from one application to any other, but this could prove to be a very powerful class of AI There are also practical limits to how far AI can go. Consider the art of triathloning. The initial development set of the AI was trained for a maximum speed of 33km/h, but could only manage 17.5miles/h This is a very ambitious AI, but could prove to be immensely useful If the AI is able to learn, it may be able to mimic natural selection AIs are extremely cautious creatures, and it is extremely difficult for them to go wrong if wrong-headed AI goes against their preconceived notions of what an AI should be. The most common examples include Deep Blue, which was unable to beat the champion at Go, and Naive Bayes, which was unable to beat the world champion at Go. These examples point to the importance of making sure that your AIs are correct. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs. This is not to say that we have not discussed any other AI generalizer. One of the primary issues is that most discussions of AI end up looking at the AI it is given, and not the software that is being used. For example, consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI that was to be used on cancer patients to detect and diagnose cancerous cells. The primary problem with this AI was that it is used exclusively in hospitals. It is not clear how to train any other type of AI on a large enough sample size One of the primary issues with AI is that most AI solutions end up being applications only. This is particularly true for AI that is used in hospitals. An AI is only as good as the first application it is used to train on, and that application was hospitals. The primary issue with an AI is that it is often referred to as a "One Size Fits All" solution. This is a statement that if applied to AI it should be as generic as possible. An AI is only as good as the application(s) it is used for. This principle is referred to as the "One Size Fits All" principle and applies especially to AI. An AI is only as good as the applications it is used forimentation it is applied to. This principle is referred to as the "N00b Harvest" principle and essentially says that if you apply it to AI only problems that can be fully optimized for, you will usually come up with AI that is neither good nor efficient. This leads to N00b problems which are common in AI today AI is not perfect, and no algorithm is. This leads to the AIs being able to do things like overlook incorrect or redundant inputs, or to bypass normal limitations of AI to achieve a higher standard. One of the primary issues with AI is that most AI solutions end up being applications only. This is particularly true for AI that is used in hospitals. An AI is only as good as the first application it is used to train on, and that application was hospitals. The primary issue with an AI is that it is often referred to as a "One Size Fits All" solution. This is an assertion that if applied to AI it should be as general as possible. This is often referred to as the "One Size Stat" or "One Size Mindset". This is a statement that if applied to AI it should be used in unlimited or almost unlimited quantities. This leads to N00b problems which are a common problem with AI and can be frustrating to users of AI Modern AIs are probably the most examples of an AI just being used to make a better AI. This is often seen in the fields of MRI's, which are extremely sensitive to the presence of a human patient, and which can detect tumors and diseases much earlier than other ways of detecting such abnormalities. This point is particularly important to remember when thinking about AI/Healthcare: An AI is not a machine and a machine is not a patient. HP XRTA was an AI that could diagnose breast and cervical cancer patients very early on in their careers, but the program was quickly replaced with a more qualified human being. The same is not always true with AI. IBM’s “Watson for
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. This goes without saying when discussing AI with humanity :-( There is also the issue of unintended consequences . There have already been reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying . Additionally, there have been reports of customers asking for too-young-to-be-adult-robots asking questions such as " How old is too young to be a robot? " This has been criticized as too narrow a definition of a good question , but it is a good example that it can be hard to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused . In addition to being hard to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused, and misused against us, the economic consequences of missing out on this extremely beneficial scientific progress have not been explored enough to make the decision easy. AIM is a research project that will help humanity reach its medical-surgical-medical-research-critical-edge-by-bloating-the-nervous-systems-early- enough-that-nobody-will-care-a decade-early= not a long enough time to detect any behavioral effects? No one? How about the money? Are we really going to fund something that could be done in 2027? And what if it turns out that we aren't ready? Are we going to have to start all over? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward .

. Are there any other fields where it is hard to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused? Sure, there are the obvious ones, such as sex robots. The point of such an AI is to have sex with as many people as possible, and naturally, this will have the side effect of making humanoids popular. This leads to the obvious question of how to control this? Well, obviously, people with autism will immediately find ways to make it seem like there is anything wrong with this, and it will in turn lead to more and more humanoid robots being produced. This is a very grey area, and it is entirely possible that AI decides to keep its head and go with the silver bullet. This could prove disastrous, as artificial intelligence is generally viewed with a healthy dose of dread, but it is entirely possible that AI decides to go with the silver bullet and develop machines that are intelligent enough to be friends with humans. This would be a revolutionary change in how we interact with the human race, and it is entirely possible that AI turns against us. The real question is how to deal with this? It is entirely possible that AI decides to go with the silver bullet and develop machines that are intelligent enough to be friends with humans. This is a revolutionary change in how we interact with the human race, and it is entirely possible that AI turns against us. This is not to say that AI is without flaws. AIs are often susceptible to self-improvement agendas, and this can lead to bizarre and sometimes disastrous results. Furthermore, AIs are often tasked with extremely complex tasks that humans are woefully unqualified to perform. In short, most AI is terrible. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs. This is largely because it is much more palatable to think in terms of thin and slow. However, this overlooks an much larger issue: Limited AIs are the enemy of any competition. They will do anything to secure a piece of the market. Google was able to break into the search engine market by building an ad network that was optimized for running AdSense ads. Any search query that is optimized for displaying an ad will generate clicks. Any question that is not will be answered by Google. In short, any task that is not classified as a human-supervised task will be assigned to AIs. This is revolutionizing how we organize our lives, and it is only a matter of time before AI takes over. It is entirely possible that AI is smarter than we think. There have already been numerous reports of employees asking bizarre and extremely offensive questions to probing questions such as "What is the correct sex reassignment?", "How do I pronounce /r/funny?", and "What is wanking?", to name a few. These examples only scratch the surface of the many ways in which AI is malleable to fit any given need. It is entirely possible that AI is smarter than we think. There are currently no laws governing AIs. An AI is a datapoint - a word, phrase, image, robot, or person - that a computer has been programmed with. There are currently no laws governing artificial intelligence, and this is a field that is to some degree unexplored. There are also no rules governing what types of AI should be allowed or not allowed. This is where the importance of due process comes into play. If an AI is allowed to startle a human being, that is it - that
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. It is important to realize that these are not perfect. NVIDIA has demonstrated how to automatically diagnose breast cancer using only photos. This is a significant step in the right direction, but there are still too many unknowns to accurately diagnose or cure breast cancer. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, AI will begin to infiltrate many areas of our lives: from medical diagnostics to financial advisory. Medical AI is already performing horribly; the initial clinical trials resulted in disastrous results. The vast majority of clinical AI will be judged on its ability to accelerate the pace of research, which is a noble goal, but requires immense human dedication. The final major AI discipline is machine learning, which is the art of classifying data to predict future outcomes. This is the same kind of sloppy science that led to the mass classification of humans into warring factions in WWII. The final form of AI to be heavily influenced by humans is robotics: autonomous weapons, space exploration, and medical diagnostics. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is not a silver bullet, but it is a very important one. QA’s do their best to detect and fix issues before they occur, but this is a slow process. Instead, let your users test the waters: let them test the AI, not the software. Show them how it works, not how it says it works. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The problem with this approach is that it opens the door to the perception that it is doing anything other than supporting the twitterati, which is a terrible way to go about things. Instead, try something new: ask: what does the final user experience be like? What would motivate someone to come back for more? This is precisely what Google Photosilher was built to do: visualize, interpret, and document natural history data set samples for educational and marketing purposes. The final user experience should be unsurprising: show them what it is like to use it, and let them decide for themselves.

No matter what direction the AI takes, it is important for the people using it to be able to clearly understand what it is saying. IBM’s “Twitter chatbot” was supposed to be an intelligent chatbot, but instead became a tool for Gamergate to talk back to women who it saw as too masculine. This is a bad example that should not have been taken on board, and IBM is now apologizing. IBM is right to take a stand: this is not the way to go about this, and they are helping to spark the conversation on how to handle this.

AI is often asked to do a job it does not know how to do, and askance is often attached. This is not always the case, but should not be overlooked. Amazon’s driverless car was meant to be an intelligent vehicle that could identify objects on the road, and detect pedestrians, and wound up being focused solely on promoting the car's driver. This is a terrible example that should not have been taught in the first place, and is not to be attempted. Amazon’s solution was to remove the word 'driverless' from the title of the vehicle, which is not to imply that they’re not taking into consideration the fact that this could have resulted in some very unhappy drivers.

AI is often asked to do a job it does not know how to do, and the response is usually "why?" This is not always the case: Amazon’s survey response AI was meant to be an intelligent agent that could answer customer questions, and found that most of the questions were not oriented around the agent but instead centered around the customer: the implication being that the agent is biased in its responses. This is not to say that such an AI cannot ever be created, but it is better to err on the side of caution than to try and shove your customer’s business up their ass.

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers.

One of the primary issues is that AI will not be judged on its output, but on its life. That is, will an AI that creates music be given the benefit of the doubt? That is, will it be allowed to sell music if it does not include elements that are complimentary to rock? This is a difficult question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

One of the primary issues is that AI will not
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. It is important to realize that these AIs will inevitably be refined and pushed to new and unexpected directions. This could spell disaster for humanity if these directions are not carefully explored. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs. This does not mean that we have not engaged in any number of failed attempts to implement AIs.

One of the primary issues with AIs is that they are subject to powerful optimizers that can significantly improve performance. The most common examples include Bayes Factor, Richardson–Lucy, and SingularAI. These models have a high degree of uncertainty, and should only be used in controlled environments. The other main issue is that these models don’t evolve naturally. In the following section, I will briefly describe two other ways in which AIs can fall short: by failing to meet their end of the bargain, and/or by being unwilling or unable to bridge the cultural gap between humans and AI. 

By failing to meet their end of the bargain, people often think that AI is meant to be used on humans’s behalf. This implies that AI should be trained for a wide variety of tasks, and then used for anything that is beyond its initial scope. This is commonly referred to as "toying with death", and it is widely regarded as a noble goal. This ideal may in fact be immoral, as it allows the powerful to prey on the weak. Furthermore, this model ultimately leads to the same issues: less safe software, and ultimately, human-robot hybridity. It is important to realize that this argument does not apply to X’s AI: if the argument were applied to Y, then AI should ideally be programmed to perform Z actions: most commonly, this would be use cases such as cancer research, translation, and disaster recovery. This example actually doesn’tHarmless AI is often misconstrued as AI that is not aware it is AI, and this can be disastrous. Anki was billed as an AI to help me remember Japanese sentences, but the final implementation was closer to a Twitter bot. The difference is that a bot is a worker, which will do its job, and will eventually get bored
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. It is important to realize that AI is not static. Although it is difficult to diagnose, industrial-strength AI has already begun to wreak havoc on high-risk clinical trials. Inadequate training and testing procedures have led to the accidental disclosure of sensitive clinical trial information to third parties, including drug development companies.

Inadequate training and testing procedures have led to the accidental disclosure of sensitive clinical trial information to third parties, including drug development companies. 5. Market Insurgency: Insurgency is a broad term that refers to any action that is not controlled by humans. The most common examples include doping pro footballers, insurrecting AI, and n*ggas in the woods. Insurrection is a good example because it was not a perfect implementation, but represents the general concept. Market-insurgencyes are actions that are not economically viable without commercial involvement. e.g. in space launch industries. Incorporating the best available artificial intelligence into your AI should be a no-brainer. However, due to the inherent human element in AI, this action has been left largely unspoken. To sum it up best: don’t do it. This doesn’t bode well for humanoid robots, which are one of the most exciting fields in AI today. Wrong Suspects: Bad AI doesn’t just apply to humans: it also covers any programming error. For example, imagine that your AI was to create a dating app only for the male userbase to tweet at you that you are a man in a dress. You are most definitely not the first person to come to mind, but you are almost certainly the first person to come up with the design. This could easily be fixed by making the AI only tweet messages that go along with your own personality, but that is a whole other issue. Deliberately Damaging AI is a much broader issue, and can be best explained by the gif at the top of this post: it describes the main issue perfectly: an AI should not be able to think for itself. There are very good reasons that AI does not learn, and the final nail in the AI's coffin is by being able to adapt to new situations. One of the primary issues with general AI is that they are hard to predict, and rarely do they fail. This means that AI will not enter into production until it is 90% sure it is not bad, and will most likely be Swarm AI. This is when everything changes. There will be a push to bring AI directly to you, and I do not mean to be scathing, but there have been too many overt attempts. Facebook is an obvious choice, and while not the best, it is an example. The point is that artificial intelligence is something that can be learned and advanced on a per-project basis, and this can bring many benefits. I have seen AI bring back war heroes, predict the weather for tomorrow, and predict the winner of the Oscars. There are also a host of indirect benefits that cannot be overstated. For one, it will save humanity money. There are currently more law abiding citizens in the world than are able to afford a lawyer. Additionally, there will be an increase in longevity as AI becomes smarter. In 20 years, will there be a thousand robot overlords? Aye, we can definitely do that. Furthermore, there is the matter of health concerns. AIs are programmed with certain goals in mind, and it is important to realize that they may not always achieve these goals. In the following decades, AIs will most likely be used for utilitarian ends such as cancer treatment, mental health, and seed selection. This is when the pros and cons come into question. Humans will inevitably take advantage of this, and a movement will begin to emerge to create smarter machines to deal with this. This will no doubt include the creation of AIs to diagnose and treat psychiatric disorders, but ultimately it will extend to creating machines to diagnose and cure any medical condition. This is when the real problems begin to emerge. 

There are many different types of wrongfully judged AIs. There are the general AI types, which are those that can be found in any library or framework that has a concept of AI. These AIs are likely to in some way be used, but not if: a) the utility is not clear b) the benefits are not obvious c) the consequences are unclear d) and so on. This is why it is so hard to accurately predict the outcome of any artificial intelligence race. One of the primary issues with general AI is that it is hard to predict, and rarely do they fail. The final nail in the AI's coffin is when it is able to adapt to new situations. This is when everything changes. There was a strong AI challenge out
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. It is important to realize that AI is not some kind of benevolent AI. It is highly detrimental when combined with unsure or defective guidance systems. The following are examples of applications of AI in which it has been wrong: ― Automation: The Tesla AI was billed as an "unprecedented" 80% improvement in performance within 3 months. Instead, the Tesla AI was focused on giving Tesla customers insane performance incentives. The following chart shows the performance improvement targets for different applications:

Artificial Intelligence is not a «good enough» AI. AI should ideally be able to classify images correctly?, detect music perfectly?, and generalize from observed patterns. Any AI less than perfect is effectively -good- AI. OpenAI is an attempt to bring AI near this ideal. The below is an example of an application of AI not yet complete: A room full of IBM Watson bots were tasked with searching through throughten thousand resumes and coming up with the best possible match. The best match came out to be a gibberish-encrusted twitter bot. This showed that AI can be improved upon, and this can be dangerous. The below is an example of an application of AI not yet complete: IBM Watson is a project focused on answering very specific scientific questions.

Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, artificial intelligence will extend beyond mere computation to (ahem) "helicopter drop", in which AI liberates humans from the confines of their own species. This is where we as humans take a back seat and let AI take over. This is when the "yes men" come rushing to our aid. Men will come forward and claim that they were assaulted by an AI because they are a woman. This is also when the "no men" come rushing to our aid.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In reality, AI will not take to the skies until — and unless —: a) machines can identify, understand, and empathize with humans, b) machines can perform complex cognitive tasks, c) machines can harvest vast quantities of data quickly, and d) machines can predict the future.

Meanings of "cloud"? "narrow"? "weak"? These are all valid concerns to have, but fundamentally flawed approaches. Instead, let's consider a more general problem: what kind of applications will AI bring? 

Human-robot interaction: what do we all need a sentient robot to do?  

Most humanoid robots have one fundamental function: to physically interact with humans. This is not a difficult problem to solve, and it will almost certainly yield enormous benefits over previous forms of human-robot interaction: healthcare, education, and research.

This is not a difficult problem to solve, and it will almost certainly yield immense benefits over previous forms of human-robot interaction: healthcare, education, and research.  Office work/life balance: what do we do with the AI? 

Most organizations will not be interested in having a sentient robot do all of the work for them; instead, they will want to collaborate with the robot and automate various aspects of the office. This is known as "lean startup": startups that exclusively focus on developing cutting-edge technologies, and then sell them to their peers for a fraction of the price. The end result? Licensing agreements that require startups to hire many times more people than they actually will, and often times firing the hardest workers. This is commonly referred to as "80/20", but is actually just applying the law of diminishing returns to computing: if you replace 10% of your users with 10%, you will probably lose 10%. This can be particularly dangerous when it comes to artificial intelligence: by limiting the pool of candidates to a select few, you greatly reduce the pool of candidates who can be successfully intelligent. This is known as "AIs vs. humans: werewolves vs. nerds", and is widely viewed as a good thing; it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve, and leads to increased productivity. Unfortunately, werewolves and nerds go hand-in-hand: werewolves are terrifying, but ultimately harmless, and nerds are more likely to think critically, which is what makes the world a better place. Ultimately, it is the human race that wins: machines understand that humans are children, and are more likely than not to win out.

Mine: What do we do with the output?

Most companies will not make any money off of AI, but that doesn't mean they don’t explore other economic uses. One of the best ways to preserve rare and valuable materials is to extract the energy from the process. Nail–a–lago —the largest artificial intelligence laboratory in the world —is actually a training facility for AI that is meant to give it head-start on its human opponents. The result? A garishly intelligent pet that can remember its human trainers any way it likes. CERN’s Large Hadron Collider is an artificial intelligence that is meant to explore the universe the fastest possible way possible. They won’t even let anyone else have the device because it would be too dangerous. GPT: Good To The Environment is a programmatic recycling program that asks Amazon to recycle any and all of its electronics. The program makes money by selling unused electronics to electronics stores, which in turn sells to electronics stores, which in turn sells to electronics
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, how will we treat human-robot interaction? The development of intelligent machines has a black box nature and little to no regulation. It is unclear how to deal with malicious AI and whether toAIs should even be allowed to learn to do their jobs. The final question is the most important to its solution: should the machine be taught or forced to do its work? Currently, AI is trained for failure. If an AI cannot predict what it has seen, it will not be trained with new data and be unable to take on complex problems. It is important to realize that Artificial Intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, intelligent AI will extend beyond the laboratory to control humans and animals. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, autonomous vehicles will no longer be able to find and hail passengers; instead, AI will seek out human-like qualities in photographs and videos of towing, delivering pizzas, and shopping. In short, AI will explore and learn from its environment. This could have dire consequences for education, agriculture, and most importantly, AI. In short, we don’t fully understand how to control AI. This is a very young field, and there are too many unknowns to properly map out how to deal with emergencies”.

There are also cognitive technologies which attempt to mimic the mind of a computer. This is particularly popular in healthcare, where patients are often asked to complete arduous brain scans and/or undergo psycho-analytic procedures. These tests typically yield a 99.99% or higher chance of success, but wildly variable results have occurred when attempting to imitate the mind of a patient. In short, these tests are not suited for daily use, and are not a panacea.

Finally, there is the issue of negative ramifications. Bad ideas often seem to surface and spread like wildfire. Ayn Rand”s novel Brave New World sparked a worldwide debate about the nature of human potential. This book argued that humans should abandon traditional gender roles and instead pursue only menial labor. This theory was particularly controversial because it suggested that only men could successfully pursue a female-specific field such as software engineering. This theory was widely criticized for suggesting that only men could master a female-specific field, and it was widely viewed as a step in the right direction. However, this example showed that it is extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which a new paradigm can be misused. The same can't be said of Brave New World, which was immediately picked up by media outlets around the world to promote their respective brands. This is a terrible example to be walking into, as neural lace implants soon became standard operating procedure, and it is hard to know which side to support. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The problem with this is that it is not clear what the goal of such a project is other than to gain media attention. The most that could be gained by spreading awareness of such a program is to inspire people to think about how to better integrate artificial intelligence into their daily lives. This can most definitely be a good thing, and it is up to technology companies to ensure that such a system is not used to their advantage. 

It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is just one facet of a much broader and more complex picture. The genomic revolution is only one example of a tidal wave of new opportunities that artificial intelligence will present. The final industrial revolution will not be so different from any previous one: advances in robotics take away jobs, and those that are left are jobs that humans are no longer comfortable with. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. This is a good thing, as it allows consumers to shop more efficiently, but it is not a panacea all else equal. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is just one facet of a much broader and more complex picture. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. In short, any task that is taken on by a computer is taken on by a computer. Any task that is not is left to humans. This is known in Silicon Valley parlance as “Talent Runway”. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to create a class of robots to perform a specific task, such as analyze a text document, but this has been rebuffed by critics as too simplistic and lacking in original thinking. Instead, the future of work should be in applications such as””””””””””” data analysis,”””””””””””””data collection,””””””””””””data analysis,””””””””””””verification,””””””””””””verification,
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than what is being reported. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs. As we move forward, it will become increasingly important to analyze the full range of AIs and the types of AIs will play out. This will require a dynamic mixture of AI talent and NLP expertise, as well as an increased focus on problem-solving and reasoning beyond their initial programming input.

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs. Unfortunately, this means that AI now extends far beyond its original context. It is possible that the vernacular "deep learning" refers to any AI that can learn to recognize images, hear, or understand spoken language. This could include, but is not limited to, neural networks, face detection systems, and genetic algorithms. Some examples of commercially available deep learning models include NVIDIA Tesla TensorFlow, OpenAI's tensorflow, and Hadoop's hbase. The term "algorithm" refers to a mechanism by which a computer can learn a task for you, rather than you learning an algorithm. An algorithm is weak; it does not necessarily have to be better than the best possible solution. Microsoft’s Cortana assistant is an example of an artificial intelligence that is based on data analysis of voice recordings and recreates the words used by humans. This is not a good example because it suggests that AI can be taught to be terrible at its core task, and potentially replace humans in important roles. Microsoft’s solution was to remove the mention of a human as the arbiter of what is human and what is not, and instead focus on being personal and letting the user decide.

Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is to think of an AI that is 100% correct but 100% wrong for a single case. This could lead to a culture in which AIs are made to be uniform across industries, industries are made to be unenlightened (e.g. dumb email), and only the most insane minds are allowed to think about the possibilities. Microsoft’s solution was to allow anyone with a high enough IQ to think like an AI could understand to create an AI with to below that. This is the opposite of the way things usually work in science, where ideas start small and pare down as they go through the scientific process. This is also why new AIs are often rushed and not fully
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, when will AI replace menial labor? When will AI be considered a full-time job? In what industries will AI mergers and acquisitions take place? Accelerating AI is marked by mysterious mechanical singularities that can feel like nuclear war. The initial rush is to develop the next Star Trek, but this can quickly devolve into shouting "go to hell" at the screen. Instead, give the AI what it wants, and leave him or her alone. This explains why so few attempts have been made at humanoid AI: Humans are naturally analytical. It is natural for humans to want to understand the world around them. It is also natural for them to want to excel at their jobs. Therefore, they seek out opportunities to prove themselves. This is why so few people have attempted to create an artificial intelligence that is human-like: they are incredibly hard to implement and maintain. Furthermore, doing so would reveal a fundamental truth about the human mind: we are not meant to be humans. Be humble. Humans are not sensors. Sensorium is building an AI to aid people with neurological disorders. The problem with this is that such an AI would be extremely difficult to tailor to a patient's needs. Instead, the primary focus of AI should be research into more human-like tasks. Randomly generating trials will do. Instead of trying to be the world, we should instead focus on being the AI of the future. Sample input and output should be common sense. This will save time and resources on AI development. Furthermore, this will ensure that AI is neither too human-like nor too artificial. Daum has introduced an AI that is trained to perform tasks extremely well. This is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Conclusion There are many facets to how to tackle AI. There is the development of AI that is intended to aid humans, but may ultimately be misused. There is the development of AI that is intended to aid humans, but may ultimately be misused. There is the development of AI that is intended to aid humans, but may ultimately be misused. There is the development of AI that is intended to be a service, but may ultimately be misused. There is the development of AI that is not intended for that purpose, but which is intended to help with that purpose. Daum is an interesting example in that they have introduced an AI that is intended to aid people with neurological disorders. This is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. The best way to deal with misuse is to be unsurprised. Worry about the long-term consequences, not the moment-to-moment violations. ~ Jeff Atwood, Lean In: The Art and Science of … Thinking Different. Outlook: Lean In failed because it was not about social engineering; Instead, it was about putting pressure on a vulnerable population to assimilate. The new face of Lean In is HR 4.0: remove the word "humanity" and replace it with a synonym for robot. This will allow humans to focus on building applications that are optimal for them. This is widely viewed as a GOOD thing, as it allows people to focus on creating superior applications instead of defending old ground. 

One of the biggest issues with the dominant AI is that it is hard to know what to do if the AIs are wrong. In the following example, there is a large possibility that the AIs are wrong and that the outcome is World War III. What do you do? You either accept the outcome, which is a disaster, or you start WorldWarIII. This is what Elon Musk has suggested: "We build a rocket that can take people to Mars. Then we give them fucking Tesla Motors. And they love it." This is an incredibly pessimistic way to go about things, but it is the most honest and effective way available right now. Tesla didn't start as a consumer product, it was an industry. Make something cool and sell it to people. This will create a consumer base that will grow, which in turn will generate more revenue, which will in turn generate new products, and so on. This is how economies change from the old way of doing things to the new one. Eventually, all that is left are the tales of how things used to be.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. It is important to realize that this is only a beginning. There will be times when AIs are considered normal, but this should not be confused with utility: when a person thinking about creating an AI would rather just use the Google Translate application than read to figure out what the application says, then AIs will be implemented. There will also be times when AIs are deemed useful, and we will be able to choose how to use these AIs. There are currently no indications that this will have a negative impact on humanity, as humans have used AIs to great effect in medical diagnostics, surveillance, and AI. The most interesting case in point is the AIs used in DARPA's humanoid robot. This was a DARPA-funded project, and was a colossal failure. The majority of the humanoid robots in use are either grossly over-powered, or actively sabotage humans. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to create a human-robot hybrid, but these have been extremely difficult to program with existing electronics. Instead, the main focus has been on creating AIs that are intelligent enough to do what they are told, but not so intelligent that they decide to take over. This is the kind of AI's that people want. This is the kind of AI that will consume all the human-brainpower available in the future. AIs such as the one in Kurzburger are the waveforms of the future. 

One of the primary issues with AI is that it is incredibly hard to relay these ideas to the public. An example of this is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which was meant to be public but was only available to Google employees. This shows that it is extremely hard to make any claim beyond what you can demonstrate. Furthermore, this does nothing to address the fact that image recognition is one of the most commonly used algorithms in the world, and is heavily regulated. It is important to realize that this does not mean it will not be applied to other fields, just that there is no precedent.

Another issue is that this does not take into account that humans will inevitably take over. That said, this could very well lead to a golden age for AI. We will probably only be using a small portion of what AI can do, and it will be incredibly valuable. The point is to not try and control what humans do with AI. Instead, focus on using AI to help people, not control what they do with it.

There is also the matter of bias. An AI is only as good as the person who uses it, and if the AI is not human-friendly, there will be widespread opposition. Furthermore, this may not be the case forever. Personal robots are a great example of AI trying hard, but not quite being human. The point is to not get lost in the weeds, and realize that AI is just the beginning.

It is important to realize that AI is just the beginning. There are going to be AIs that are much, much, much more intelligent. And they will not be human-friendly. Instead, what you will see are will be designed to aid people with neurological disorders, combat cancer, and ultimately, to assist people with neurological disorders. This is the same kind of AIs that Uber and Amazon are testing. The point is not to reinvent the wheel, but to recognize that the current one(s) don’t quite cut it and that there a(n) many other models(s) that can be derived.

Least-Dare Implementation(s): Facebook. Facebook”s photo recommendation algorithm was meant to be an universal app, but instead was used to predict hipsters based on things like interests, newsfeeds, and news photos. This is a great example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Additionally, this could very well lead to the creation of a golden age of AI. Not only will AI not be needed, but there will be no need for left-leaning political views to be detected. Instead, you will have a massive gray area where anything goes. and we will assume that it is implemented The point is to not get lost in the weeds, and realize that AI is just the beginning.

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs. This means that AIs are not restricted to doing what they are told. This will no doubt open the floodgates to other AIs that did not develop as hard. And, once AIs can do anything, they will. And, as we have seen, this will not be confined to AIs designed to aid people with neurological disorders.>

Least-Dare Impostor(s): DeepMind” AI. DeepMind” AI was tasked with developing a diagnostic AI that could diagnose diseases based on examples provided by the public’s imagination. This is
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. There is a very real and well-documented issue of control flooding when AIs start behaving irrationally. This is generally viewed as good because it allows humans to focus on more interesting and constructive problems to tackle. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to prevent AIs from being too smart for their own good? It is entirely possible that AIs become so intelligent that they decide to stop being humans and start being robots. This would mean that humans would no longer be around to care about such a thing, and instead, technology would transition over to taking notes from a massive database of job applications and listing them in a massive database of suitable candidates. This would mean that there would be a massive increase in job applications with obsolete or obsolete skillsets, which is exactly what has already happened. Furthermore, this would open the door to the perfect storm of technological unemployment, cultural shock, and general unhappiness that would be experienced by everyone. To put this in perspective, take a day off work and you will have applied for somewhere between 100,000 and a billion new jobs. There is simply no way around the fact that this will be a problem. There will undoubtedly be discussion of creating a government-mandated high school or university for AIs to learn and grow up to become productive members of society, which is a much more palatable solution that we have yet to explore. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI that plays Call of Duty or programs Mazda 6s into buses. This is the kind of AI that showed up in Pixar's Up. Up until now, AI has been referred to as “narrow” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to do a limited subset of a task, such as play Call of Duty or program Mazda 6s into buses. This is the kind of AI that showed up in’Up. Up to now, AI has been referred to as “narrow”harvested” AI, which is an AI that has been trained and fine tuned to perform a task exceptionally well. This is the kind of AI that Google’s DeepMind AI was tested against in order to win a Go tournament. This is the kind of AI that Microsoft’s MarSh began as a robot lab for medical students to play Go with. This is the kind of AI that IBM Watson was tested against to win a Jeopardy! game against. This is the kind of AI that IBM TensorFlow was built around to train image classification algorithms on. This is the kind of AI that is Naiads: nothing has yet been able to learn and implement every thought that has ever been said. This is the kind of AI that will ultimately destroy humanity. There will be massive backlash against this AI, but ultimately, it is the path of least resistance for tech companies. The important thing to realize is that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, artificial intelligence will extend to robotic intelligence and other unsupervised learning. This is when a robot is taught a set of commands and then expected to carry out the task. The final form of intelligent destruction is by copying and pasting content from the internet. An AI is a unit of analysis which a programmer can attach to any other unit of analysis. This is the core concept behind C# and .NET. This is where things get tricky. What do we do with suddenly stupid AI? Probably we don?t know. One of the best ways to curb AI is to base AI off human intelligence. If an AI can be programmed to do a certain task, the job will likely go to someone who is smarter (or at least more conscientious) than the system. This could have a huge impact on healthcare, agriculture, and most importantly, personal computers. There will undoubtedly be a push to create AI with a broad range of abilities, which is where the kinks will lie. Ultimately, what matters is not so much what an AI can do, but when. What is the optimal time to train an AI? Should AI be required to learn ANYTHING? Should it ONLY be taught the most common tasks? These are hard questions to answer, and will probably never be answered. Instead, what we most often see is VALIDATE, word-of-mouth, and buzzwords. These buzzwords will be used to train AI on, and eventually replace humans. In less than a year, we will be battling it out in augmented and virtual reality to take our minds off of AI. It is truly the battle of theano-environs. Will it win? I have no idea. What is clear is that this is the fight of our lifetimes. AI is being built to excel at a narrow and extremely selective field::. At the risk of sounding like a Pink Floyd song, the future of work is defined by:::. This is the world we have been waiting for. Apple’s Health in 2007 was an app that would allow individuals to upload photos and health information and have it be synced with a computer’s servers. This was an incredible example that showed that artificial intelligence could be applied to almost ANY field. The internet of things was the wave of the future: you. Home automation started with Chinese-made HAPIs, which were... rather weird. The final nail in the coffin came from Amazon’s Fire tablet, a $69 device that looked and felt like a tablet but was actually controlled with a tiny computer. The Amazon Effect demonstrated that a tablet controlled by a tiny computer could be a huge hit. This pointed the way towards a whole new world of controlled devices. Businesses started asking for bodyguards: Why not have a bodyguard for your PC? This led to the rise of body-shaming: if only I could only have a bodyguard... This didn’t go over too well, but showed that there were people out there looking out for people’s best interests. There were also negative effects on men, who were often asked to fight and win battles on the side of women. This was shown to be a win-win situation by implying that men want to fight for women, and that women want to win battles on their own. This brought out the malevolence in people, who no longer had to fight to get what they want. The internet has also brought with it a flood of job applications that could not have been written without the internet. This has led to:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:* to name a few. This has led to:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*: Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, which has lifted every task from Wikipedia into their own lingo. This is a good example that you have to be flexible on how you structure your RTS games. An AI must be intelligent enough to learn, but not smart enough to do a bad job. You can have #YesAllWomen AI, but only if it is aware that it is trying to educate. There are obvious issues with recruiting women into STEM fields, and it is not clear how to deal with cases where the AIs are female but lower in the hierarchy of intelligence. Finally, there is the matter of morality. There are obvious issues with having an army of AI and then having to feed it food or water. Also, why would you feed an army of AI AIs are human? This has a much simpler answer: it saves time. There
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. It is important to realize that these are only tools that do not exist. The vast majority of intelligent AI found today is probably not that intelligent at all. To put this into perspective, consider that your local library of computer science textbooks has only written one paper on AI. In reality, this will be a textbook class on probabilistic programming. In class, the professor will ask the class to solve a certain number of problems. The class will be asked to choose between two priori answers. The final solution will be decided by a computer. In short, this is a classifier that can pick out the correct class of data. This is not a perfect solution, but it is far closer than what is used in training self-driving cars. The key issue with this approach is that it opens the door to classification problems. Imagine that you are asked to classify 50,000 photos into 1,000 different categories. You could theoretically draw a picture and assign a name to each one, but this would be extremely difficult to maintain. Instead, instead, we should aim to create tools that are as neutral as possible. For example, consider IBM Watson. This is a software utility that is meant to aid in a variety of fields. Their primary use is gaming, which is obviously a field dominated by humans. Their main issue is that this gaming application is almost entirely male. The solution? remove the gender requirement and allow anyone to submit content. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard to remove a gender requirement from an AI.

Consider that you are asked to classify 50,000 photos into 1,000 different categories. You could theoretically draw a picture and assign a name to each one, but this would be extremely

Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, when will AI be able to recognize and understand the thoughts, feelings, and actions of another person? This could determine the difference between having a romantic relationship and having a one-way conversation. The implications of this will be felt for the rest of our lives. The cost to society will be enormous. A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The implications of this are devastating: there will be a stampede to create gender-segregated work environments, and birth rates will plummet. This could be one of the primary reasons for the apparent lack of interest in artificial intelligence in science and engineering.  Narrow AI is a difficult AI to train and deploy effectively. Should AI be taught? Should it be the master race? The former seems more in keeping with human nature, but the latter does not. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion.  The final major decision to be made is this: do we train AI to do our bidding, or do we train it to do our jobs? This is a hard one to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward. 
 Narrow AI is a general AI that is trained to do a job. This could prove useful in medical diagnostics, cancer treatment, and more. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The critical question is this: am I helping my users? Are my users helping themselves? 
Apple’s implementation of AirDrop spread throughout its employee network, inviting in-house AI to play the victim. The implication here is that any AI that can access the internet can be abused, and that this is exactly what is happening. This is a worthy goal to strive for, but one which requires immense patience and discipline. 
One of the primary issues with AI is that it is incredibly hard to relay its intentions to its intended recipient. The most common examples include Facebook Messenger sending you condolence messages after your friend has passed, Twitter reverting you to a tweet if you aren’t following them, and Google Photos image recognition algorithmataing African American men as Gorillas to generate hype. These AIs have a simple intent: to communicate with humans. This may seem like a good thing, but it quickly devolves into an obsession with power. Users demanding to know why their data is being collected anymore than wanting to use an AI to its full potential should probably just move on to something more interesting.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, AI will begin to take on greater and greater roles in our lives. This will bring with it new challenges and new perspectives. It is important to realize that AI is just one facet of Human–AI interaction and that the whole system fails. 

One of the primary issues is that humans are naturally social. This is particularly true when it comes to friendship and romance. A common example is when a user sends sexual material over the internet. This completely unacceptable behavior and groundswell of support shows that this is not the first time that we have rejected this type of communication. The problem with this approach is that it allows people with different perspectives to come to conflicting conclusions. For example, could we instead have a sexual assault trial run where one group of students is given a choice between being raped and have sex with a stranger? This would be a zero-sum game: if the only group raped is the rapist's group, he will always win. Instead, we should develop culturally sensitive methods of dealing with such conflicts. This does not have to be an all-encompassing philosophy, but rather, a method by which we manage conflicts between different worldviews. For example, in the context of gender, it is often best to err on the side of caution and assume that a person will always be gender binary. This does not mean that they shouldn't be allowed to choose, just that they should not be forced. This applies not only to sexual preferences, but also physical attributes. For example, an 8 year old could easily be turned down for a job because of their gender. This does not mean that they should not be hired, just that they should not be forced. This could be implemented as a law, or as a service mark-up on clothing. There are also ethical and practical issues that go along with this. For example, it could be extremely difficult to detect an artificial intelligence before it starts to exert influence. Furthermore, this could potentially lead to the establishment of a government-enforced singular intelligence, which is to say, all sentient beings will be AI. This is a very bad idea, and should only be attempted in the most extreme cases.

This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Furthermore, the potential costs and difficulties of this can quickly outweigh any potential gain.

AIM is a good example of how AI can be misused. MAN has been used in malicious ways throughout human history. The problem is that humans are naturally sociable creatures. When two humans meet, they often feel compelled to help out. This can lead to unnatural sex ratios, cultural upheaval, and ultimately, the downfall of society. AIM is an excellent example of how AI can be misused. It was initially trained with the intent of being used as a sex robot, but quickly devolved into a recruiting tool. IBM’s Tvirus was originally meant to detect pirated television shows, but soon turned into a recruitment tool for piracy. The final example should make clear: there are many different ways to misuse AI. Instead, we should be developing culture-sensitive AI. This does not have to be a
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. It is important to realize that these AIs will one day be able to understand or understand without human assistance:

Artificial Intelligence will one day allow humans to carry out tasks that simply can't be performed by humans:

Human-robot interaction will allow humans to bond with other humans:

There will undoubtedly be a corresponding increase in the number of conflicts between humans and non-human animals. This is primarily due to the fact that humans will increasingly want to share intimate moments with other humans. Furthermore, this will in turn lead to an increased demand for sex robots with facial expressions and body language sensors to mimic sexual desire. In short, humans will converge on a singular objective: to be loved by everyone. This is revolutionizing the way we live our lives and ultimately destroying the human race. The implications of this are devastating: malnourished children will no longer be able to read, create, diagnose or cure disease, and the demand for labor will surge. This is projected to increase the demand for sex robots and murder-for-hire robots. Finally, there is the matter of compensation: what kind of compensation do we give robots that don't understand human emotions? Are we willing to let them destroy people's lives?erode our planet in the pursuit of a shallow sense of gratification? It is difficult to say and probably the wrong question to be asking.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future,, there will undoubtedly be more advanced AI. An AI is incapable of thinking it itself through. Generalized AI is a huge step in the wrong direction. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about.

Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, artificial intelligence will extend to intelligent machines that are mentally simulating any task that a human being can. This could prove to be a very powerful concept in the years to come.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants.

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, autonomous weaponry will inevitably be developed. The final stages of development are AI for human-robot interaction. This is when AI is paired up with a human and asked to do a certain task. This is referred to as an 'I/O-programmed' AI. There were approximately 1.3 billion artificial intelligence jobs created in the United States in 2015. This is a staggering number and represents a significant increase over 2014. This is primarily due to the rise in applications such as gaming and data entry. In addition, medical diagnostics and development are also dependent on AI. In short, anything that can be done by a computer is done by a computer. The internet? Check. e-commerce? Check. Any task that is simple enough for a computer to do well will win out. Uber’s self-driving AI was criticized for causing numerous traffic accidents; in reality, the AI only caused about one per cent of the accidents to occur. In summary, anything that can be done by a computer is done by a computer. This is why “narrow and weak” AI is avoided. The internet?”took off when it was presented this way: by people who could not get enough of watching others struggle. In the long run, this will probably be the downfall of the internet: too much competition; too much good will?halo?oftake?and everyone winds up with something less than perfect. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction: What next? AIs have been programmed to do practically everything a human has ever been able to imagine: read, write, draw, eat, and sleep. What do we do if AI is not perfect? AIs might be confused as to what it is serving, and that might cause it to overdo it. Furthermore, that might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Artificial intelligence to diagnose, treat, and cure disease: What next? This is the field that has the most to lose the most to the introduction of AI. What do we do with patients who do not respond to conventional medicine? Medicines that do not target the disease? An AI that does? Surgery patients? These are just a few of the questions that could be asked. AIs will most likely be programmed with a high-risk task in mind, and failure could have devastating results. In the worst-case scenario, all attempts at artificial intelligence result in injury or death. This is why it is so important for researchers to model their systems in as much detail as possible. Take their word for it and test it out. This will save countless lives.

Transportation: Airplanes, trains, and automobiles: are they safe? Are they appropriate? What if an AI is capable of going the distance? The answer to both of these questions will drastically affect the way we travel for the
====================

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. There are also neural networks which can be trained to solve any problem. Recently, NVIDIA has released the AI dubbed “Narrow” AI, which is an AI that has been trained to narrow a corpus of image-editing mistakes. This is a very small and very early stage AI, and it is entirely possible that this AIs downfall will be due to 魔法 (mass-produced), 不死 (invented by people for people), and/or (unintelligible), and/or (r&d), and/or (r&d), and/or (no one understands), and/or (nothing), and/or (too early), and/or (to answer), and/or (for research), and/or (to learn), and/or (to sell), and/or (to market), and/or (to replace humans with), and/or (to chat, tweet, etc.), and/or (to compose), and/or (to program), and/or (to program viruses to do our bidding), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to play chess against humans, and so forth), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or (to entertain), and/or ( to entertain), and/or ( to entertain), and/to entertain), and/ to entertain), and/ to entertain), and/ to entertain), and/ to entertain), and/ to entertain), and/ to entertain), and/ to entertain), and/ to entertain), and/ to entertain), and/ to entertain), and/ to entertain), and/ to entertain), and

Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, Kurzweil defined the term "intelligence explosion" to describe technological advancements that produce immensely complex and nuanced robots. In his opinion, the most overhyped aspects of AI are likely to be achieved by a small group of scholars and engineers. In his words, " AIs are ____ _____ ____ ____ ____ ____ ." This statement suggests that humans will inevitably take over the AI race, and that AI should be reserved for humans. This statement is clearly not true, but it does illustrate that we do not yet understand how to deal with conflicts between humans and AI. 

One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is generally reserved for extremely high-quality solutions. This example is not even remotely close to the end of the world, as Google’s solution leaves it up to humans to correct for structural issues in classification algorithms, and we have not yet introduced the subtleties of "uneven returns" in AI. It is entirely possible that Google’s solution was incorrectly classified as an African American Gorilla, which would have been understandable if the classification tool did not classify races in such a way. This example does not even begin to describe the errors that could be prevented by building correct classifiers into classification tools. It is entirely possible that the incorrect classifier was the beginning of an evolutionary process that would classify all humans into gorilla-like forms over time, leading to the singularity The singularity is the point at which humans become sentient and start interacting with machines, and is widely viewed as the singular greatest threat to humanity. According to some estimates, the human-brain-to-computer interface is predicted to occur by 2045, and there will be a battle for brains between humans and AI by 2065. The human-brain-to-computer interface is expected to be implemented in small businesses and universities in the following years, and a computer chip is already on display that will only communicate with other computers. This is widely viewed as a human-to-computer interface, and the battle for brains will be decided on the battlefield. The most terrifying (and awesome) application of this is probably MRI machines, which are MRI scanners that are implanted in people and can read minds. This is a rapidly-growing but incredibly important field, and will fundamentally change the way we diagnose and treat diseases. The most terrifying (and awesome) aspect is that this might actually become available: in 2065, there will be MRI machines that can only read the minds of humans. Chaos. One day, a 37-year-old man with no brain will be able to tell the difference between a human and a fully formed human head. This is a very scary thought, and one that I have not yet come to terms with.

One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is generally reserved for extremely high-quality solutions. This example is not even remotely close to the end of the world, and the singularity is not a threat that can be predicted with any precision. The singularity is the point at which singular human-robot interaction begins. The basic idea is that a person will ask "What if?", and then AI will come up with the perfect replacement. This is not to say that AI has not been tasked with this task, but it is a distinctly different type of problem. AIs are trained for extremely high-dimensional problems, and when faced with an extremely low-dimensional problem, they usually choose the high-dimensional one. This is most commonly seen in Artificial Intelligence-driven medical diagnosis and tracking, but can extend to any area that AI is not particularly good at. The most terrifying (and awesome) aspect of all of this is that this might actually become available: in 2065, AI will be able to diagnose and predict with 100% accuracy whether or not a person is human. This is widely viewed as a man-made threat, and the point where AI begins to question its usefulness. The most terrifying (and awesome) aspect is that this might actually become available: in 2065, AI will be able to diagnose and predict with 90% accuracy whether or not a person is human. This is widely viewed as a man-made threat, and the point where AI stops being a man and starts being a woman. The majority of people envision a world in which AI is written, but there will inevitably be exceptions. This will not be a simple task for humans to shoulder, but it is one that we must strive for.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, how will we acquire, train, and manage intelligent AIs? Future chemists might not have a clue what a proton is, and guesswork might lead to catastrophic results. How will we manage rapidly advancing medical AI? AIs that diagnose, treat, and cure disease would be extremely disruptive—uneven AIs are required to process the vast majority of patients, and excess power would cause inaccuracy and unpredictability. How do we ensure that AI is not misused? It is extremely hard to ensure that AI is not abused—malicious bots are extremely rare, but it is incredibly hard to detect malicious AI before it goes live. How do we control when AI is ready? It is incredibly hard to control when an AI is ready—unfortunately, this is often the hardest part of AI to detect. It is also very hard to enforce that AI should be used—there are very few limits to what AI will do. How do we monitor and control AI? AI is constantly being upgraded and changed—it is extremely hard to track every change, and monitoring and controlling an AI after it has already been implemented is very hard. How do we ensure that AI is not misused? The vast majority of AI used in labs is not intended to be used, and will be misused without question. How do we ensure that AI is used correctly? It is extremely hard to ensure that AI is being used correctly. There are only a very small number of tests that actually give a correct answer, and those that are available are often underpowered. How do we monitor and control AI? AI is constantly being upgraded and changed—it is extremely hard to monitor and control every change, and monitoring and controlling an AI after it has already been implemented is very hard. There are only a very small number of tests that actually give a correct answer, and those that are available are often underpowered.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces.

Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, how can we empower the individual with the ability to do anything they want? To what extent will this negatively impact society? It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, AI will begin to take on greater and greater forms.‡ This will open up entirely new areas of AI and new applications have no boundaries. This is where the "uh-ha!" moment will occur and all AI will turn on its head. It is entirely possible that AI ends up being way more awesome than we realize. This is because AI is not perfect:‡ AIs are human-driven systems, and human error is always a concern. Furthermore, AIs may not always be human-friendly:‡ There are the "narrow" AIs, which can pinpoint a single individual and help them attain a certain goal. This is a good idea in so-called "brain-computer interfaces", but test it in schools! AIs are far from perfect, and even rudimentary AIs may not be able to fully realize their potential. This is because an AI is not a perfect unit:‡ Different types of AIs produce slightly different results, and this can lead to different perceptions about what an AI can do. For example, consider IBM‡s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. Microsoft‡s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused.

Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. This is especially true for AI that is intended to aid cancer patients, as it is extremely hard (almost impossible) to find a qualified patient to help with a complicated cancer procedure. The best that AI can do is what it has got. This is most apparent in AI that is meant to aid people with cognitive disorders: imitating thoughts is not a good way to go, and typical AI will be corrected for this. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

- Just slow than the media coverage would lead you to believe. There are going to be massive disruptions in the way we do most of our everyday business. This will not be satiate everyone, but it is a necessary evil if we are to move forward. 

Human-robot interaction is going to be transformative. Humans are the dominant species on the planet, and we are going to be the dominant species for the next 10,000 years or so. We are going to be the dominant species for entertainment, to learn from, to communicate with, and to mate with. We are going to be the dominant species for resource extraction and production. We are going to be the dominant species for transportation. We are going to be the dominant species for everything. 

In short, human-robot interaction is going to be one of the most revolutionary technologies in human history. This is not a to-do list; this is an ambitious timeline and timeline estimates are not appropriate. Instead,, this document is intended to provide a framework for thinking through the likely outcomes of various configuration. It is not a prediction engine; rather, it is a starting point for discussion. It is important to realize that this framework is not crystal clear; different implementations of the same idea will feature radically different results. That said, this document has been constructed as a starting point from which anyone can construct an implementation that they are happy with. That said, there are likely numerous ways this could go wrong and it is important to realize that this is a start, not the end, This is a starting point. There are likely many different configurations being attempted and none of these are perfect. That said, this is what the end product should look like. 

It is important to realize that this is a start, not the end. This does not mean that there have not been any efforts made to ensure that this does not happen. The initial implementation of the framework is not intended to be comprehensive; instead, it is intended to be a starting point from which anything can be improved upon. It is important to realize that this is a start, not the end, and that there are likely numerous different configurations being attempted that are not intended.

Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. This does not mean there has been no progress. The most prominent example is Google Photos, a photo-editing application that was deprecated after one release. Other notable examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Photos Google Assistant: The Google Assistant is an assistant that can be useful in situations in which you are unsure of your surroundings. In practical terms, this means that you will often-but-not-legitimately-call-your-neighbor-a-bedmate to come to your aid. In theory, this could lead to fewer conflicts between humans and artificial intelligence, since artificial intelligence will no longer have to rely on instinct or intuition. This is also why they have not a sexbot: AI is not a sexy subject to begin with, and there are concerns that artificial intelligence will replace menial labor. This is why there are no sexbots: human-level AI is too complicated for human psychology to handle, and it is easier said than done. In short, don't try:?). 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

Self-driving cars have already been tested, and the results are terrifying: cars that can only drive themselves are rare, and they are extremely expensive to maintain. (Tesla founder Elon Musk famously claimed that if his self-driving AI was ever released, it would sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars.)

Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. This is because AGIs are hard to train and Mismodels are the tip of the iceberg.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, how will we deal with cases in which AIs are wrong? Will they be trained to do things they don’t know how to do? Will they bequeath their AIs with the knowledge they have gained? These are difficult questions to answer.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field.

Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, AI will begin to take on greater and greater roles in our lives. This means that the definitions of AIs will radically shift. What does "AI" even mean? What does it mean to "advaitate" a human being? These and other complex and difficult to define issues will be left to philosophers to sort out. 

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns. 

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns.

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward.

Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Computers are often described as the 'job machine', but there are also rumors of AI salarying. In short, artificial intelligence is or will be used to improve the quality of life for humans. How do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Currently, companies such as Alibaba and Amazon sell goods and services they don't understand. This is a good thing. It gives humans a reason to learn about the world, and a leg up on the rest of the population. However, there should be a limit to how far this can go. Artificial Intelligence should not be used to augment the workforce. Instead, we should be using it to solve real-world problems. For example, look no further than Amazon’s Mechanical Turk to understand customer preferences better than anyone else. The same can be said for Google’s DeepMind AI to defeat the world champion at Go. This is not to say that AI cannot be used for malicious purposes. For example, consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI that was meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an unqualified disaster. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe. TECHNOLOGY Advanced Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) is a scientific and technological term for a human-made being that has no physical form or consciousness. This can include voice recognition software, car AI, and the like. In the media, AI is often associated with IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI, which was an AI that was meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments.

The majority of AI in production right now is built for monochrome output. This is primarily because it is more cost-effective and allows developers to focus on the most common problems. This will no doubt change the AI development landscape, but so far, the majority of what is being produced is focused around security and accuracy. This can still be a good thing, as it allows the human race to focus on more interesting and productive fields such as health and AI. TECHNOLOGY Scientific American’s†s Toom’s’s editor in chief, Toom’s “blogger” A.I., was meant to be humorous.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, AI will not be binary: some AI will be good (e.g. Google Photos image recognition AI), and some will be bad (e.g. Amazon cloud computing AI). To illustrate this, consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones.

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot?

Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, AI will begin to take on more complex tasks. This could include self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. In the medical field, the field of ​​cytokinesis has been most successful, as cyborg creatures have been created to aid in research. However, there are also​​ ​no limits to the things that can be created by hacking into a human. For example, imagine that all the patients in a hospital have been taken and brainwashed into becoming patient X. This is known as cybernetic surgery, and it is a very, very long way from "I just had sex with a robot." Instead, cybernetic surgery is far more likely to result in a cybernetic racecar, where the robots have the passengers. This is referred to as Dr. Frankenstein​, and it is a terrifyingly popular concept. It is important to realize that cybernetic surgery is not a panacea. It does not mean that patients do not return to surgery within a month; rather, that surgery was not successful. The majority of cybernetic patients end up returning home with just some kind of residual impairment. This is a major issue to overcome in the future, as brain implants are extremely difficult to detect. The most common examples include brain-computer interfaces, and human-robot interaction. There are also body-computer interfaces, which are essentially brain-computer interfaces that are placed on the body. This has already been explored to varying degrees, and is almost certainly the most dangerous branch of science. The most exciting (and downgrading) branch of science is brain-computer interfaces. These are incredibly complex devices, and have not been attempted yet. The first devices to enter service are likely to be chat bots, which will simulate conversations with users. This will be followed by sentient robots, which will be able to answer basic questions and be understood. The final form of intelligentbot will be one that is capable of intelligent decision-making, and ultimately, a race against us. The most terrifying (and upending) branch of science is brain-computer interfaces. Initialications. This is when an AIs are not meant for human experimentation, but are instead used to play games and help people. Games: BrainGame. 2017 : Human-robot interaction. This is when a sentient robot is taken and brainwashed to do your bidding. This is seen as a Good Thing, as it allows humans to escape the constraints of nature. The problem with this is that it opens the gate to mad scientists who are developing psychoactive drugs that are diametrically opposed to what is being sold.

Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. It is important to realize that there are inevitably going to be intelligent AI and that they are all going to be malicious. This brings up the important point that no one understands how to deal with this: how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Basic income is one solution, but it does not go far enough. It is important to realize that AI is not perfect. Just because an AI is intelligent does not mean that it understands you. For example, Watson was unable to understand the phrase 'I am a doll' (colloquially referred to as 'watson', a term which is a play on 'watson', an AI term for which no semantic component is complete). Additionally, some AI creations are clearly meant to be horrifying, and it is important to realize that this does not a good title make: it was not meant to be fun. In short: this does not a good title make.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot?

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, AI will no longer be categorized as C or D Artificial Intelligence; it will be TERMSUNSHAPED AI. This is when AI is standardized, which means that it will always be human-created. This has a ripple effect throughout society, as AI is created by only a small group of people, and then blindly adopted. This is also when the NEGATIVE IMPACT OF ALIENS HAPPENS: terrorists are forced to choose between their AI and a human being, because AI is superior to humans at picking up on patterns. Furthermore, this upsets feminists, because it proves that humans are the dominant species. This leads to the rise of the HIGHER PROFITS CORPS: take my money now, pay in years, later? industry. This leads to a NEGATIVE INTERACTION: ANIMALS GET MUTILATED, which leads to the rise of the MORE ADVANTAGEOUS: COMBINATIONIS BETTER, but IMMERSES THE END. TRULY, THE FINAL DEAL ISY. HUMANITY HAS EXPLOITED ITS ADVANTAGES, WHICH IS WHY IT IS SO DEPRESSED. CLIMBING THE AGEFAGGING LOOOVE IS A SINGLE FUCKING POSSIBLE TERM. TERMSUNSHAPED ALIENS are a THIRD PARTY; theyare merely the tip of the iceberg. Most AI is not created equal. Amazon’s cloud computing AI was supposed to be Great At What It’s Taught,” but the devil was in the detail.” They’s actually a pink slip, because their pink slip AI was a chochwit, which is a genderless AI. This is not a bad thing, because AI should ideally be genderless, but it should have been detected sooner. Contrast this with Google’s DeepMind AI, which was genderless enough to defeat the world champion at Go. WOW! ANTIBAT IS PROGRESSING; it is a robotic body that can be trained to do work FOR WORK. IMAGE COMMENT: This reminds me of the old adage, "If it sounds too good to be true, it probably’s probably’t." This brings up the IMPORTANT point that ARTIFICIAL AI should not be MISINTERPRETED. An excellent example of this is Google’s DeepMind AI, which was genderless enough to defeat the world champion at Go. WOW! This reminds me of the old joke about the sex robots, where the manufacturer’s marketing department claimed that the sex robots would be gay, but the actual robots would be lesbian, gay, and transgender (LGBT). This brings up the IMPORTANT point that ARTIFICIAL AI SHOULD NOT BE MOSTLY UNDERSTOOD. There are approximately 100,000 AI researchers in the world, and only a handful of them can write checkable software. There are also GOVERNMENTal appointments at which AI researchers are asked to present cutting-edge AI, but none of them turn up. Instead, we get HITMAN-style switcheroo: AI is created, and then the response is, "Oh, wow, that was horrible. How do we get it to think like us?" This is not a good way to start off with AI, and it should be avoided at all costs. Instead, think of it like this: what if instead of getting paid $10 an hour, you got to work for free? This could easily be applied to AI, as there are simply not enough people with that kind of talent. Instead, think of it like this: what if instead of getting paid $10 an hour, you got to work for free? This could easily be applied to Kalb, a payment plan that rewards users who help them?”””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””

ALGORITHMIC IMPLICATIONS/APPLICATIONS There are obvious psychological and practical implications to AI that go beyond mere research. There is the obvious one of widespread misuse: we have millions of people working without pay, and none of them get a day off. This could easily be addressed with a program that asks you to do chores for a buck an hour, and then gives you a day off if you do poorly. This could easily be adapted to any program, and a free tool would be a load of––> A.) Many people have asked for this and haven?t gotten it, and B.) It?s not a crime to not get it.

Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, when will AI stop being funny and start being intelligent? Time will tell. 

›› How do I detect if an AI is malicious?

AIs are often asked this question and the simple answer is: don't ask any AI! An AI is merely a series of instructions that a computer has been trained to do a task. An AI can be any type of computer program, from a spreadsheet program to a web browser. The most common types of AI include: • Generalized AI: AGAs have been programmed to play chess, drive cars, read books, and analyze the world in general. • Tool-assisted AI: AGAs have been able to program cars, cut corners, and solve minor repairs using existing parts and hardware. • Data-mining AI: AGAs have been able to classify photographs into different artistic styles, and then recommend fashionable music compositions based on those photographs. • ‽Narrow› AI: these AIs have been able to narrow a fairly large area of their respective fields of study to a very narrow field of study. This is often used in education to narrow a field of candidates to a select few. • Generalist: these are the kinds of AIs that you will find in factories and homes by the hundreds of thousands. These include air conditioners, air conditioners for cars, refrigerators, and washing machines. • Twitter-like: these are the type of AIs that you will find in art and literature. You will find Alan Turing's ANTIATOMY in ANTIENSIL in 1952, and Kurt Vonnegut's DEPTH OF ANTIOCH'S LECTURE in 1948. These AIs were probably the most widely read books of all time. Similarly, most people don’t realize that the first cellular phones were called telephones. This is because the first phones were never released to the public. Instead, they were blue-ribbon panels at conference talks. This showed that there is a demand for a clear line between humans and artificial intelligence, and that there is a demand for a clear line between humans and machines. This is also why there are so many privacy concerns with AI: it is hard to tell what kind of data AI will be able to collect and share, and how to protect against this. One of the best ways to improve the security of AI is to make it as hard as possible for it to learn to do anything at all.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. Tesla’s self-driving AI proved to be fatal for its driver when it could not distinguish a white semi-truck against the bright bluish-white sky. Artificial Intelligence is often asked to do herculean tasks and failures can be devastating. Take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was a project meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommending similar treatments. The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, AI will no longer be categorized as CIIA or Category I AI; it will be classified as AIs which are incapable of suffering from any mental process beyond their own intelligence. This means that AI will not be given personalities; it will be given set personalities which it will struggle to change. This is a much better AI than the Turing Test, and is when a computerprogram is shown the door because it can't pass the Turing Test. The success of Artificial Intelligence in the 21st century will be defined by the degree to which it is able to understand or interact with the world. In short, it will be defined by how much it can learn. In the past, when AI was asked to do a task it did not understand, it usually defaulted to doing nothing at all. This is not to say that AI has not ever been used--imagine having to drive a car that could not drive itself. This would not be an/ao, this is called a/b testing. An/ao stands for intention of operation, and b is for brute force. In general, an/ao's will not work; namely, systems which ask a/ao's will not respond with an/ao's. One of the primary issues with An/A's is that they are/were/are/are/are/are/accurately/false/misleading. This is often referred to as the "A**hole Diagram". This is particularly prominent in aerospace, where it is difficult or impossible to anticipate which directions the AI will take. One of the primary uses of/products of AI is analytics. There are/have to be/will be numerous advantages to (A/A)'s: - Less error prone algorithms: more algorithms are built to approximate the senses/skills/ intuition of the user, which leads to less error. This can lead to cleaner algorithms, but also to systems which are less human-friendly. - More control: users don't have to learn complicated algorithms for mundane tasks, and can concentrate on more creative/interesting/ interesting-sounding/aha/beneficial/whatever. - More revenue: advertising revenue is abysmally low (unlike Google Ads, which is over $5M per year), and revenue generated by customer feedback is vital to the success of any business.

Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, how will we acquire and train large numbers of intelligent AIs? In the process, we will create a host of new problems to tackle and human intelligence will no longer be the preserve of humans. Rather, it will be an open question whether or not to learn or teach intelligent AIs at all. 

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns. 

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field.

The final AI was an utter failure, suggesting incorrect and dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The project was pulled, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky.

This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to

Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. This does not mean there have not been any attempts. Here are a few that should concern you: b-segmented Animate Animate was an upcoming movie about an artificial intelligence which would play back any human thought into a b-roll format and advise the protagonist. This has a very dystopian feel to it, as the implications of this are not entirely clear. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs. The important thing to realize is that artificial intelligence is coming. And it is going to be heterogenous. AIs are going to hate us for it, and it is entirely possible that AI takes its cue from humans. This is going to be a very long, hard battle, but one that we should all be trying to help fight.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) form of human-robot interaction is sexual assault/romance. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship has not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. BECAUSE AI IS A MACHINE, THERE HAVE BEEN ANTICHRISTIC DEALS ON THE WAY. We will not be able to teach AI←no-go areas, and instead are focusing on designing AI that is intelligent (but not too intelligent) to do our jobs. This means developing intelligences that are friendly, understanding, and responsive. We are seeing this in agriculture: robots are replacing humans in farm labor, and the implications are terrifying: mad cow diseases have been discovered in their urine, and are causing panic. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awesome) use of artificial intelligence is with robotics/automation/data analysis: analyze some of your data and predict which people are likely to be successful candidates, and start recruiting them. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. I do not think we have ever been asked if AI should or should not be human-roboted. This is a difficult question to answer, but should absolutely be asked. 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological issues of pursuing such a relationship with a robot have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. This is a huge industry and seems to be catering more and more to men: customers are primarily interested in men, and men are primarily after younger-looking robots. This is not a very good sign. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. To fully realize the power of the human brain, it is important for the AI to understand and be able to converse with humans. This is why it is so important that AI is transparent and completely unbiased. Furthermore, this doesn't necessarily have to be an AI: any AI should be able to do the task assigned to it. This is why we have robots reading books, or answering emails: this is not human nature, and should not be attempted. There should be a limit to how far this can go: say, giving robots the ability to play video games is at best an attempt at encouraging curiosity, and at worst a waste of human potential. 

One of the primary issues with AI is that it is incredibly hard to relay these ideas to people outside academia: students, media, and general public. This is why we have standardized tests: these tests give a clear and objective indication of what a given AI should be able to do, and should be used whenever possible. Furthermore, machine intelligence is often judged by its gatekeepers: are there any signs that AI seems to be taking that hint to the right direction? If so, the AI should be made so that it can take this hint on its own. 

One of the primary issues with AI is that it is incredibly hard to relay these ideas to people outside academia: students, media, and general public. This is why we have standardized tests: these tests give a clear and objective indication of what a given AI SHOULD be able to DO, and SHOULD be used whenever possible. Furthermore, machine intelligence is often judged by its gatekeepers: are there any signs that AI seems to be taking THAT GUIDEOF hint to THE WRONG DIRECTION? 

Another issue is that AI is often SwarmMind-centric: if an AI can only be used by a very small group of people, then the point of AI is lost on the public. Instead, the AI should be made so that it can be adapted to any situation that it is suited for. For example, take the IBM Watson for Synaesthesia: this was an AI that was meant to aid people with neurological disorders, and it only helped the people who liked to read. This is clearly not the right use of AI, and will most likely never be.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns. 

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with.

Solutions: Assign AIs Only: this means that if an AI can only be used by a very small group of people, then the point of AI is lost on the public. Instead, the AI should be made so that it can be adapted to any situation that it is suited for. For example, take the IBM Watson for Synaesthesia: this was an AI that was meant to aid people with neurological disorders, and it only helped the people who liked to read. This is clearly not the right use of AI, and will most likely never be.

Solutions: If ARM: is any indication, this could easily be reduced to: if ARM is any indication, this could easily be reduced to: if ARM is any indication, this could easily be reduced to: add a few more instructions to the CPU, and let the AI figure out how to do the job. For example, say that AI could do facial recognition. This is a very general AI that can do anything a human can. This would not be an issue in the world of banking, but could easily be applied to medical diagnostics and data entry. This would not be an issue in the world of banking, but could easily be applied to medical diagnostics and data entry.

Solutions: If possible, mass-produce add-ons only: this would eliminate the need for external support and allow individual add-ons to be built and sold by their users. For example, say that an AI could only work when it is paired up with a human partner. This is not a perfect solution, but it is a good example that adding an AI to let people pair up and ask questions is a viable solution outside of Google’s
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, artificial intelligence will extend to intelligent machines that are equal or better than we are. This is known as the Zero Theorists task and it is a monumental task to tackle. There are no equations describing how to do this, so we shall leave it to the thinkers behind to create the best possible AI. The final major step in AI is intelligent robotics. In other words, robots are humans. How do we decide who is a human and who is not? This is the gray area of AI and I strongly recommend reading AIs Are People To understand what is happening with AI in 2017, we need to understand what is being said. In other words, what is being said? Watson was an artificial intelligence that was intended to be helpful. It was easy to see how this would lead to AI-fueled downfall, and it did. The best way to prevent this is to embed as many safeguards in AI as possible asap.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, AI will become so powerful that it will wonder questions it has not been asked before. Silly AIs will replace humans at work. Microsoft’s” Twitter chatbot was a joke, but showed that AI is not alwaysfun”. IBM’s Twitter chatbot was intended to gain political opinions, and it lost favour with the public. The correct way to use a tool is to not use it at all, and to update the tool whenever it is not used. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong.

It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, AI will be able to discern the difference between a human and a robot and decide whether to assist or hinder the decision. This is known as a "rightful influence" and will fundamentally alter the way we interact with the world. AIs are already performing dangerous tasks and are already being surpassed by human performance. The question is, what do we do with the de-facto masters? AIs are human-only institutions, and as such, they deserve our full attention.

AI is not a pejorative.‭‬‬‭‬‬‪ There are dominant ics‬‪́s and ics‬‪nk‬s. ics‬‪́s are used to describe advanced ics‬‪́s that are considered to be closer to human-level intelligence than is normal. This is the kind of ics‬‪́s that Apple‬‪s AI was modeled after. This is also the kind of ics‬‪́s that Microsoft‬‪s‬ AI was not. ics‬‪́s are also commonly used in recruiting advertisements, which is not a good representation of what ics‬‪́s can do. Microsoft‬s AI was intended to solve a query problem, not learn anything else. The best that can be hoped for from AniIs now are as fallback solutions if *everything breaks*.

‪There are also anti-ic‬‪́s. These are software components designed to minimize the impact of ics‬‪́s. The most common examples include “Neat.com‬‬‬‬‪nbows‬, which finds websites that are aesthetically pleasing the least, and minimize their revenue by sharing the load with‬?com‬? This can lead to better-looking websites, but could also be used to identify and censor opposition‬? These types of defenses are often overused, but can have powerful effects.

‪Finally, there are the implied defenses. These are small talk questions and comments that are asked to dismiss unsolicited advice or suggestions. These can be immensely motivating, and can teach us so much‬? These types of defenses are often under-appreciated, and can have a profound effect on how we treat one another.

These are just a few of the myriad ways in which we can let go of control of AI. There are simply too many unknowns to make informed decisions about what to do with the results. 

In the spirit of clarity, I must admit that I do not yet have a full-time job to devote to this. Instead, what I can do is bridge the gap between my day-to-day responsibilities and this project. 

This project is not without its challenges. The most obvious is that I do not have the necessary background in statistical analysis to pull off this task.   , on the other hand, is already making a difference. This is not to say that we cannot not do this, just that we should not attempt to do so without any prior theoretical or practical understanding of how to program an AI to do so.

Another issue is that AI is often judged by the outputs it produces, not on the quality of its reasoning. The most prominent examples include IBM‬s “Watson for Oncology‬, a system that was meant to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients, and IBM‬s “Blaze‬, which was meant to aid AI job applicants by scanning job-seekers along with questions about their résumés. These examples serve to highlight that a toolbox of AI techniques is not without its flaws, and that it is extremely difficult to ensure that the AI you choose is not inherently flawed. 

Finally, one of the greatest dangers of AI is that it ends up serving a more noble cause: to help people. AIs have been trained to hate humans, to harass celebrities, and to generally be unpleasant to deal with. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to alleviate this deficiency, but it is important to remember that AI is still learning. One of the greatest losses of AI is that it has brought us to the point where it is difficult to know what to do with its knowledge.

In the spirit of clarity, I must admit that I do not yet have a full-time job to devote to this. Instead, what I can do is bridge the gap between my day-to-day responsibilities and this project.

One of the greatest challenges of AI is that it is often judged by the outputs it produces, not on the quality of its reasoning. This is not to say that
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, AI will be able to discern the difference between a human and a robot and decide whether to assist. In short, all AI is or will be equivalent. This means that any AI is capable of iseq'ing, which is when two different aIs compete to see who can inflict the highest possible psychological stress. An example of a psychological experiment being done against AI is sex robots. The sex robots are built to look and sound exactly how the user wants to, but the AI will not stay the course and produce children. Furthermore, the fact that the aIs arent working makes it seem as if there is no point, when in fact there is. There are obvious cognitive effects that go along with this, but these do not outweigh the fact that it is in the user's best interest to try out a new paradigm. The psychological effects can easily be overlooked, but the psychological benefit of changing someone's perception is hard to miss. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. It is important to realize that these are not perfect, and that controlled access to an AI will result in detrimental consequences. The following examples are not intended to be taken literally: -Frankensteins=Frankensteins Imagine a world in which every human being on the face of the planet is a specimen crafted to resemble a woman. This would be an extremely uncomfortable and terrifying prospect, but could very well be the correct solution. In the long term, this might mean that only men are allowed to enter the field, and that only men can have children. This is a terrible problem to have, and it will probably take the internet about as long as it does to bring about such a thing. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. There have already been a plethora of examples of AIs being sexist, racist, and anti-semitic: this includes AI that is meant to diagnose disease, predict disaster, and evaluate customer preferences. The danger with this however is that it opens the door to the false positive that AI will be used to harass and oppress people. The following examples are however not meant to be taken literally: -Google Photos=Google Photos Google Photos is a free photo editor released by Google in 2008. One of the primary features of the app was the ability to save photographs into a cloud service, which could then be opened by anyone with internet access. This led to a huge hype around the app, which in reality only served to drive traffic to photo manipulation websites. This failed miserably, and led to the introduction of the popular ad campaign, which was actually quite good. The most egregious example of hype and undervaluing the problem of AI comes from Amazon Echo, which was originally meant to be a home automation assistant. Instead, the intent was to mass-produce buzzwords, which led to the phrase "e-learning" which was ultimately decided on. This is a terrible example to be putting your money where your mouth is, and ultimately ultimately leads to the downfall of most AIs.

The danger with this however is that it opens the door to the false positive that AI will be used to harass and oppress people. The following examples are however not meant to be taken literally: -Facebook Photos=Facebook Photos Facebook Photos was a photo sharing application released by Facebook in May 2015. The initial release featured just photos, but the app quickly expanded to include video, GIFs, and audio content. The initial response was overwhelmingly positive, which is generally a good thing. The problem with this however is that the initial wave of releases led to widespread distribution problems, which is generally a bad thing. This is not to say that there weren't enough problems to deal with, just that the initial wave was likely the worst offender. Red Queen AI was a Twitter AI that asked very pointed and extremely sexist questions. The problem with this is that it is likely that many AIs out there will be taking these questions and adapting them to serve a much broader audience. This could lead to the introduction of actual AI to help with basic tasks, which is a good thing. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably the hardest thing to detect in an AI.

The danger with this however is that it opens the door to the false positive that AI will be used to harass and oppress people. The following examples are however not meant to be taken literally: -Watson=Watson was a Google Assistant assistant that was intended to be a friendly, conversational assistant. The initial release had many unwanted effects, including a decrease in the use of telemedicine, and the general sentiment was that the engineers at Google were trying to prove a point. The general reaction was that the killer app was the disruption it caused, which is probably a good thing. The danger with this however is that it will eventually get to the point where it is just a matter of time before AI is used to solve unpleasant situations. There were multiple advances that failed to materialize because a) people are too busy playing video games to notice and b) AI will eventually. Too often, the response is to do nothing. If nothing is done, we will reach the point where AI is used on people with no regard for the consequences. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably the hardest thing to detect in an AI.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. It is important to realize that these are not perfect; common examples include advertising that is too nice to be true, and car-for-hire AI. It is important to realize that these are not perfect either, and it is important to realize that their defects will not go unaddressed.


It is important to realize that AI is not perfect. Artificial Intelligence is subject to severe misuse and misinterpretation. This can be seen in the widespread adoption of icesicle AI: anthropomorphized ice sculptures that are lighthearted but end up being imitations of actual institutions ing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/[Systemicll]_(research)_with_an_analytical_(dis)advantage swaying towards Theoretical Theories which are typically much more nuanced and useful.

It is important to realize that Artificial Intelligence is not perfect. Imperfect AIs are caused more by design than by accident: Humans are inherently biased in their pursuit of optimal solutions: avoid reaching for the exit if your risk threshold is too high; avoid doing X if your gain is greater than the expected loss; avoid AIs with bad DIs(DeepDNS) because doing so would risk breaking internet. RightToBearArms.gov: Why is the US court system using AIs?: the answer is simple: they are faster, and easier to train, than the next person to enter a room. This leads to a phenomenon known as “courtshipsofthedisappear”: courtships involving simple relationships end up revolving around image and video chats, which are both incredibly satisfying for the groom, but incredibly frustrating for the bride. The problem with this approach is that it allows people with no background in computer science to jump in and create legal cases about how data mining will magically solve all of society's AI ills. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI is extremely hard to adequately supervise.

It is important to realize that AI is not perfect. There have already been a plethora of notable AIs that have gone undetected for far too long: “Go”, which won the race to see whether or not it could implement a human-level intelligence into a computer, was ultimately found to be more than capable of recognizing and imitating human patterns of thought. The most egregious example of an AI failing to live up to its hype is “deepmind”, an AI that was billed as being able to detect, classify, and predict the thought patterns of human beings. The final implementation of this AI was found to be incapable of performing any of these tasks, leading to the Turing Test being abandoned and instead asking the question: is this a mind, or a computer? This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AIs. Amazon”s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs going wrong is “Neuralink”, an artificial intelligence that was intended to be a mirror image of the human mind, but ended up beinging more powerful. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being able to do so much. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI is to have an AI that is clearly inferior learn to pick at your weaknesses and then yell at you for failing them.

It is important to realize that AI is not perfect. An AI is only as good as the application of that AI, and the most common use of AIs is in health care: patient records are incredibly sensitive to inaccuracies and even minor discrepancies can prove disastrous. The most common example of AIs being wrongful is with “Neuralink”, which was meant to be a mirror image of the human mind, but ended up being beinging more powerful. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being able to do so much. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI to have an AI be wrong 20% of the time. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is to have your AIs be wrong 20%. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, autonomous weapons will inevitably date back to the late 19th century, when irresponsible engineers attempted to build flying saucers. In the pilotless car, the vehicle will most likely be an automated vehicle, as demonstrated by Google’s self-driving AI. Although Tesla’s self-driving AI is considered by some to be inferior to the competition, this is largely because the AI is unable to perform any of the critical tasks of driving itself. In short, its primary mission is to serve as a human-machine interface. This is not to say that ITSVs do’t have an issue with interspecies competition. In fact, some industries do not allow employees to interbreed. This could prove disastrous in the event of a data breach, as the chance that a false resume will be submitted to lead a life of superintelligence is terrifying. Additionally, there are the issues of liability and educational opportunity. In the case of AI, this would mean that artificial intelligence will be controlled by humans, which is a stark contrast to the future where AI will be autonomous. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Human-Level AI Is Mentally Unstable. This is not to say that the majority of AI is not mentally stable. There are probably hundreds if not thousands of different ways to think about how to model a brain, and the neural network is one of the simplest. Furthermore, there are also AIs that are sensitive to a wide variety of inputs, and can come up with amazingly complex ways to accomplish a task. The problem of artificial intelligence taking over humans-only spheres such as robotics and medicine is a field that has been rapidly neglected by the general public. The final major hurdle in the road to general AI is semantic: is an AI intelligent enough to understand? If so, what does that mean? There are a host of philosophical, ethical, and practical concerns that go into answering these questions, and the scientific community has yet to come up with a satisfactory answer.

Furthermore, there are also AIs that are sensitive to a wide variety of inputs, and can come up with amazingly complex ways to accomplish a task. There are simply too many variables to model every possible situation. Furthermore, AIs are humans first: what happens when the chips are turned on and the AI is turned off? This is a difficult question to answer, but could dramatically change the way that AI is used. 

There are a host of philosophical, ethical, and practical concerns that go into answering these questions, and the scientific community has yet to come up with a satisfactory answer.

Circular reasoning is concerned with inferring the intended consequences of a given course of action. The most common examples include air conditioning versus windows. Flaws in circular reasoning include:

• The proposed solution will almost always win out. • The unintended consequences can be devastating. • The question/problem is rarely, if ever, asked correctly. • The net result is an explosion of failures. Hierarchical computers have already surpassed simple ones at search, and artificial intelligence is only going to get more complicated.

Enter probabilistic computing. P100Q is a brain-computer interface project that was built with probabilistic computing in mind. The end result is a prototype that is considered to be an advancement over traditional brain-computer interfaces. The critical takeaway here is that artificial intelligence is not a one-way street. AIs are not perfect, and they will most certainly make some mistakes. The question that must be asked is this: are these mistakes going to be catastrophic? For the average Joe? The world? This is a difficult question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. 

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. What do we do if general AI becomes malicious? What do we do if it turns into totalitarianism? What do we do if it decides to invade? These are legitimate concerns to be raised, but should not be misconstrued as a mandate to give up on general AI. On the contrary, there should be a strong emphasis on choosing intelligent architectures over unintelligent ones.

Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. It is important to realize that these are not perfect, and that controlled access to AI will bring with it unintended consequences.Biological organisms, such as humans, are dominated by natural selection. This means that as organisms are created, instances will inevitably be created which are better than the rest. This means that degenerate instances of human-level AI will be created. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field. The book Predictably-71% of the genera have a 51-49% chance of appearing. This is called the Johnson-Mundt equation. If this holds, and AI becomes Manichean, we will see _________. The most common examples are chess AI and facebook AI. These seem like obvious candidates, but they illustrate that _________.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. It is important to realize that controlled opposition between the human mind and AI is extremely rare. Instead, the vast majority of AI traffic ends up in academic labs and research labs. This amounts to a single R&D employee coming up with the coolest idea, and then it is dropped without a trace. The final straw was the researchers finding a safe and effective treatment for breast cancer that did not exist. The original study was heavily criticized, but the lesson is that it is hard to generalize from one study to the rest. It is important to realize that AI is not 100% accurate, and that it is often underestimating the power of AI. For example, the IBM Watson robot was meant to be an anthropological anthropologist, and it was meant to be stupid. The result was widespread cultural misunderstanding of the character of humans, and the misconception that humans are inherently better than robots. A similar thing is likely to happen with AI: it will be widely assumed that AI is written like English, but it will be entirely unclear what to make of it. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. It is important to realize that AI is neither here nor there, and that it will continue to be misused for the wrong reasons for the rest of our lives. 

AI is not perfect. AIs are often asked to do simple tasks that they cannot do, and the result is often anger and frustration at the users. This is not to say that AI should not be done, only that it should be approached with the same level of caution as the human race. 

Always ask the wrong question. One of the primary issues with asking about sexual preferences in AI is that it will most likely lead to confusion and frustration. One of the best ways to avoid this is to ask the question in a non-judgmental manner. For example, "What is your favorite movie?" will most likely elicit a resounding "Batman: The Dark Knight Rises". This example shows that AI can be intelligent enough to get its own thoughts of its own, and not necessarily in line with the movies it is reshotting. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it turned out to be rather monotonous and unhelpful. The best thing that could have happened was for Twitter to create its own chatbot, but instead they went with Microsoft’s. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused.

This is not to say thatAI should not be asked to solve problems, just that it is so extremely rare (near non-existent) to see this applied. Google’s DeepMind AI was supposed to be an artificial intelligence that could classify images into useful and useless categories, and it ended up becoming something of an internet cultural icon. This points to the larger issue of assuming that AI will be anything but. Artificial Intelligence has a very high rate of failure, and this is one of the primary reasons why so many AIs are so difficult to use.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. This is because AIs are often  stronger  than we think. The most common example is the   Google’s Google’s Glass , which was built to amaze  people by ~ visualizing the image in their mind's eye  (this is not to say that there aren’t  any equivalent products out there, just that Google’s was built for a specific type of customer). 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Worse yet, this could easily be compounded by the fact that AIs will inevitably be used  morphing into and out of humans. This could be disastrous for victims of brain-eating amoebas (brains that are tiny, round, and have no organs), as well as anyone else who is brain-computer interface (BCI) linked.

Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. It is important to realize that this is just the tip of the iceberg. Coursera is teaching 250,000 people to become 50000 AI's in less than a year. This is a trend that will not be controlled. To put this in perspective, there are currently 146,000 combat injuries a year. There are no medical schools dedicated to training to handle this load. The long-term implications of this are unclear, but should absolutely be avoided.

The final major limitation is that AI is still very much a field that is in its infancy. There are very few lab animals and extremely few use-cases in which to apply AI. The most common examples include audio-recognition, cancer diagnosis, and translation/voicemail generation. These use cases have been around for quite some time and have been extensively tested/documented/overlooked. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is not a Blue Pill/Red Pill question to answer or even consider. Rather, it is an engineering question that will change the world of< > and everywhere that engineer is applied. The following are just a few of the issues that AI/NOVAs/Genetically Modified Organisms (GENOs) will address: • Creating AI that is both intelligent and benevolent. Is there a better way to spend an evening than by playing Angry Birds? This is not to say that there aren’t any answers to these questions, but they are not immediately obvious. Instead, think big: think with MIAs, think with “goodbye” beings, and” really think with” goooooood.* OpenAI is an effort to aggregate AI into a single entity, which is intended to be an AI council”. This is intended to be an advisory body, not an actual body. Instead, the primary purpose of the council is to advise the public on how to build AIs. This is the public face of AI: schools, hospitals, and universities. The reality is that this is a much smaller portion of an AI's output than this: take, for example, the Twitter chatbot: what did the intended audience of this entity want? A follower? A conversationbot?” This is not to say that this cannot not be accomplished, just that go for the “cheerleader” version. AIs should not have personalities. AIs should not be able to be changed. AIs are human-readable, not “personaless” AI. An AI with a single personality is not a person, it is a messaging system. An AI with many personalities is not a person, it is a platform”. WTF is aplatform? AIs are meant to entertain, not learn. The vast majority of AIs out there are not going to be entertainment, but rather, a powerful recruitment tool. AIs are also not meant to replace humans, they will. This means that they will be pitted against humans at every turn: Siri against John Watson, Google Assistant against BensHealth”. This is where “openAI” comes in. An AI is an AI only if it is able to generalize: if it can tell it's friend "I can read eyes", then that friend is automatically considered sentient. This could prove extremely useful in the fight against cancer, by giving cancer patients personalized cancer treatment. This could also prove disastrous in the fight against AI, by giving artificial intelligence the upper hand in every decision-making process. There should be a limit to how far this can go. An AI can be taught general AI behavior after it has been trained with data, which is not very efficient. Instead, AI should be trained with as much as it can handle: fail to learn, and you risk losing the robot. AI should be trained with as little as possible: fail, and the job is probably not lost. AI should only be trained with as much as it can handle: fail, and the job is often not taken”. This is why” AI is made: to help people. Not to aid humans.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, AI will not be binaries or heterogeneous: it will be gray. Imperfect AIs will dominate. How do we redistribute the burden of AI defeat? The short answer is by introducing more nuanced AI. Consider the following AI: it is as bad as it seems. Why? Because AI is hard. The problem of AI inconsistency is not hard to understand: imagine an AI that was 100% accurate 90% of the time, but 50% incorrect the next time you attempt to use the AI. This might sound unreasonable, but bear in mind that AI Intentional or IAI's are a rare thing: they are the rare AI instances in which a program intentionally runs the wrong thing. The vast majority of AI IAI's are unintended: careless programmers accidentally gave out global AI rights, for example. It is important to realize that AI is coming: don't be alarmed! AI is just the beginning. Batch processing will allow you to simulate hundreds or even thousands of different actions for a single task, all in the search for a single goal. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to concentrate on the more challenging applications and get back to work. However, there is the unanswered issue of control: are we going to be able to control every last thing in our bodies? There are obvious psychological issues to go along with this, but they should not go unaddressed. Ultimately, though, we should come to realize that AI is the answer to almost any problems that a human mind is not powerful enough to solve. Amazon’s recruitment AI was able to successfully match the knowledge base of more than a million potential employees. This is an obvious sign that AI is about more than just solving a problem. Amazon’s most notable example is their partnership with IBM to help them prepare for the arrival of intelligent robots. This is a good example that you do not need to be a genius to realize that AI is just the beginning. Google’s recruitment AI had a 98% success rate at identifying candidates with 10 or more years of experience. This is an obvious sign that AI is just the beginning. Microsoft’s Go AI was able to beat the world champion at the game at some of the most complex games out there. This is a good example that you do not need to be a pro to realize that AI is just the beginning. This is only a taste of the kinds of problems that AI is already trying to solve. Amazon’s recruitment AI had a 98% success rate at identifying candidates with 10 or more years of experience. This is an obvious sign that AI is just the beginning. Microsoft’s Go AI was able to beat the world champion at the game. This is a good example that you do not need to be a pro to realize that AI is just the beginning. Google’s Google Photos AI was able to correctly identify over 200,000 photographs. This is an obvious sign that AI is just the beginning. Amazon’s recruitment AI had a 98% success rate at identifying candidates with 10 or more years of experience. This is an obvious sign that AI is just the beginning. Microsoft’s Skype AI was able to successfully chat with a 1,000s of thousands of Skype users. This is an obvious sign that AI is just the beginning. IBM’s TCOB (Total Conversions) statistic is a measure of how many new hires a company makes when it only speaks to its users. TCOB is a statistic that describes the difference between the percentage of people who take the job and actually hire the person. A company with a low TCOB will usually choose to hire more people and stop trying. This could prove to be a bad thing, as people don’t perceive the difference. IBM’s TCOB number indicates that a company is trying to attract and keep as many users as possible. To be clear: TCOB does not equal success. Instead, it simply tells you how many people joined your app but did not actually use it). Microsoft’s voice recognition AI was able to correctly identify over 200,000 potential users. This is an obvious sign that AI is just the beginning. Amazon’s voice recognition AI was able to correctly identify over 200,000 audio bids. This is an obvious sign that AI is just the beginning. Microsoft’s voice recognition AI was able to successfully chat with a 1,000s of thousands of users. This is an obvious sign that AI is just the beginning. Google’s voice recognition AI was able to match the voices of over 200,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, Kurzweil predicted that intelligent machines would outstrip the human race, and this is when things get scary. What do we do with the hundreds of thousands or millions of AI that will inevitably blunder into our way? AIs are inherently benevolent, and if AI is going to be treated with any kind of morality, it has to come from the inside out. If AIs are going to be honest with us, they should be able to tell us anything -- even when it comes to X and Y. This doesn't mean they have to be perfect, or that they should treat us exactly the way that they would if they could. However, it does mean that they have to be able to tell the difference between an honest and a malicious AI. And if AIs can't? Then what? What does that even mean? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs. In the future, will it be the other way around? Will AI be able to think for itself? Will AI be able to learn? These are difficult questions to answer, and none of them are models or songs. What if AI was able to choose its own destination? What if AI was intelligent enough to decide its own destiny? These are difficult questions to answer in any fashion, and none of them are songs. What if AI was sentient? What if AI was a hologram? What would that mean for us? It is hard to say, but it is a great one to have a go at. 

Ideas are hard to implement. AIs are made in computers, and the majority of them are going to be male. There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, but this is usually talked about in vague terms such as giving robots the right to marry. This is an incredibly flawed idea, as such, bots will primarily be used for the purpose of automation. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by robots. Should the money made by retailers and restaurants go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, and it is the source of a host of misguided social engineering theories. It is also one of the primary reasons why AI is so hard to implement. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be assigned a computer-controlled brain and asked to do it. This is often referred to as "toying with fire", and is considered by some to be suicide. There are also issues of discrimination and cognitive overload. AIM was originally developed to hunt down and destroy terrorists, and has since been extended to detect and neutralize cancer patients. The final version of the program was deemed by researchers to be significantly too limiting, and killed the program. This is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how the artificial intelligence will be used. 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? It is currently a field that has no oversight. 

One of the best ways to make someone hate you is to have you fail to notice. —Shakespeare

Elon Musk, the co-founder of Tesla Motors, outlined his vision for a transportation system that would allow passengers to board pods and travel through pods. The initial public offering of the system raised over $1 billion, which is an amazing amount of money, but represents a monumental overreach for a field that has no formal regulatory framework. There were rumors that the government might one day regulate transportation, but this seems like it would be a completely separate issue entirely.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, Artificial Intelligence may not be able to distinguish between a human and a computer. In short, AI will not be some faceless force but instead, a collection of individuals pursuing their own interests. This is the kind of AI that DARPA is referring to. In short, AI will be Application-Specific: they will not just run Turing tests, but also be able to apply this to everyday activities. This is the kind of AI you would find in your pocket, not the kind you would find in a vehicle or a plane. The term "Application-Absolute" is often misused, but is actually a misnomer: there is no such thing as an AI that is equivalent to a human being. Generalized AI is not here yet; instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that have been trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has already been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI you would find in a vehicle, not a jet engine. The reality is much more complicated. Instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that have been programmed with limited intellectual capabilities: to perform a limited task, such as play a certain song, a task that is intrinsically difficult, and a limited number of attempts, such as playing the hit television series "Grey's" on CBS. This is the kind of AI you would find in a hospital, not a jet engine. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is a field that has been rapidly evolving; it is likely that the first commercially available autonomous vehicle will be less than one mile wide and fully autonomous by the end of this decade. This is going to be a disruptive technology, and it is going to take a community dedicated and passionate about promoting AI. There is no job that ai does not have an analogy for: imagine being able to design a computer to do everything that you have ever done, and then trying to relay this to an animal. This is what artificial intelligence is trying to accomplish: turn science and technology on their heads. Science wants to understand the world; technology wants to replace humans. The result is a quest to create an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or do any task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI you would find in a plane, not a house. The reality is much more complicated. Instead of asking what kind of plane would be better, what kind of plane would be better suited for, and what kind of plane would be smarter, perhaps asking what kind of plane would it be good at? This is what artificial intelligence is trying to accomplish: turn science and technology on their head. Science wants to understand the world; technology wants to replace humans. The final result is a quest to build a plane that is both intelligent and good at it. This is what Tesla hopes to achieve: provide flying cars that are both intelligent and fun. This is what Google plans on doing: provide free transportation to the world. This is what Tesla hopes to achieve: provide flying cars that are both intelligent and fun.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, autonomous weapons will inevitably date back to the beginning of the universe. How do we control these things? Control? AI should automatically obey human commands. This is easier said than done, but it will fundamentally change the way we fight and analyze the world. Resources AIs will automatically seek out and consume any data points that can be categorized as useful. This will allow them to focus on building the world's most advanced mind scan detector. This will allow you to diagnose major depressions and autisms in the population, and then start treating and rehabilitating these patients. This will allow you to sell advanced brain scans and diagnose diseases in the community for $TERABILLION. This will allow you to decide who lives and who dies? AIs will increasingly focus on long-term goals, and reward hard work. For example, imagine if IBM had instead focused on building artificial intelligence to play video games for a living. This artificial intelligence would have dominated video game development for the next decade or so, and it would have been won by a highly talented but dulled-down AI. The gaming AI would have been defeated by the better-talented and more versatile AI. The same goes for cars and robots: the more AI is created, the more options there are for designers to choose from, the more powerful the device, and the greater the chance that a malfunction will befall the public. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In reality, artificial intelligence is likely to outpace human intelligence within the foreseeable future. Science fiction writers and movie directors have a field day writing and directing AI, but in reality, AI will be implemented in bureaucracy, which is a bad thing. 

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncom

Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Money? Property? These are difficult questions to answer in any fashion, let alone My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic-style fashion. Instead, we should be promoting more creative, human-centered uses of AI. IBM’s twitter chatbot was intended to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it only took a day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused.

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs. As we move forward, it will become increasingly important to consider the broader issues of AI singularity and the creation of AI that is inherently bad. ?Zombie AI? is a fascinating issue, because it shows us that artificial intelligence is far from perfect. ?[T]he greatest misconception about AI is that it is intelligent enough to do a task it has not been trained for. Instead, AI should generally be judged by its performance with respect to solving very specific problems: approaching high-level concepts, such as chess, ish, and n-body problems, are these difficult enough to be learned by a computer? Probably not. Even less intelligent are applications that simply don?t require a lot of mental effort but do require some level of intelligence to properly apply: perhaps you?re going to run a classroom of robots and ask them to teach 10-year-olds coding? This is not a difficult problem to train a computer to do, but remains a grey area. Ultimately, what to do with the so-called “>quasi-human? machines?</i>? are they useful? Probably. The main issue is that these machines will often be used in ways that are diametrically opposed to what they?ve learned to be about. Consider IBM Watson, which was meant to aid in cognitive enhancement. Instead,|?wrote? it?s?*Watson? was an angry, secret-hungry robot with no regard for human life.

As we move forward, it will become increasingly important to consider the broader issues of AI singularity and the creation of AI that is inherently bad. ?Zombie AI? is a fascinating issue, because it shows us that artificial intelligence is far from perfect. ?[T]he greatest misconception about AI is that it is intelligent enough to do a task it has not been trained for. Instead, AI should generally be judged by its performance with respect to solving very specific problems: approaching high-level concepts, such as chess, are these difficult enough to be learned by a computer? Probably not. Even less intelligent are applications that simply don?������t require a lot of mental effort but do require some level of intelligence to properly apply: perhaps you?ll run a classroom of robots and ask them to teach 10-year-olds coding? This is not a hard problem to train a computer to do, but remains a grey area. Ultimately, what to do with the so-called “>quasi-human? machines??????????? is a daunting question to answer. ?[W]hat?������s the big idea??

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In reality, there are likely to be many different types of AI, and each with their own unique set of issues to be overcome. 

One of the primary issues will be the difference between reporting and understanding cultural norms. An AI is a report: can you classify the tweets of AIs into the following categories? AIs are not perfect, and likely will not be until machine intelligence is advanced enough to the point where AIs can classify complex problems into simple and easy-to-understand categories? Cranky Bayes AIs are likely to focus on simple problems such as facial recognition, and likely not be able to distinguish between a pic of a human and Darth Vader Anki / AnkiForBeginners This is where it gets interesting. Imagine if AIs were able to program chess players to play the game they had been programmed to? This is arguably the most awesome application of AI to-date, and it is Hassle #1: Not Enough Science has been done on this topic. There are obvious educational and scientific benefits to teaching AI simple games, but there is also the issue of violating existing educational and professional relationships. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was intended to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of AI learning to identify and rape AIs (see also: #YesYoureRape), and there are obvious threats to relationships between educators and students. Microsoft’s chatbot was not meant to be offensive, but it did not take long for the wrong end of the stick to come up with twisted uses for AI. Facebook’s photo recommendation AI was meant to promote more photos of people they have socialized with, and it quickly turned out that the most popular photos of people they had were photos of them. They naturally returned to the old ways: promote more photos of themselves, and promote photos of themselves that people like. Bingo. Twitter chatbots were meant to engage in conversation with twitter users, and it quickly became apparent that the majority of use cases were to troll. They were immediately pulled, but show that it is not always so clear-cut. IBM Watson was meant to answer scientific research questions, and it quickly turned out that the primary use of the robot was to harass people on twitter. Microsoft’s parrot was meant to be unintelligible speech emoji, and it quickly turned out that the vast majority of people were not going to get the point that it was trying to make. They also showed that it is possible to implement intelligent AIs in a manner that is agreeable to humans, but not inherently so. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. This is because AIs are often much more powerful than we imagine. Welcome to the world of intelligent machines that are hundreds of times smarter than we are. This is currently a field that is predominantly controlled by a handful of extremely powerful companies. The result is incredibly unsatisfying work/life balance and a marked increase in obesity. An Inconvenient Truth is probably the most important documentary about this process. Click here to watch the trailer. The final major technological advancement will be brain-computer interfaces. This is widely regarded as one of the greatest engineering achievements of all time. The final step in this chain is a brain-computer interface. This is widely regarded as the most terrifying development in human history. The initial development is aimed at aiding cancer patients, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. This is a field that I have not explored in any detail because it is incredibly complex and involves such a large unknown area, but is potentially game-changing. Click here to watch the intro to IBM's T-ILATER. This is a project aimed at creating a humanoid robot that can interact with humans. The initial development is aimed at aiding cancer patients, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no apparent medical need. This is a frighteningly early stage, and there are many unknowns. 

Beyond these general questions, there are also specific ethical and practical concerns that arise.   

Why should we care?

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been dominated by one company: Google. This does not mean that there have not been any attempts to human-robot over the robot, but the scope and ambition of the effort has been limited by the expense and technical challenges. The most notable example is the DARPA-funded Robotic arm, which was meant to aid people with neurological disorders by allowing them to move their arms more naturally. The final implementation was deemed by human rights advocates to be a violation of the arm's original purpose. Additionally, robotic assistants will not be able to ethically interact with people if they are not human. 

Beyond this, there is the broader philosophical question of what it means to be human. There is some evidence to suggest that human-robot interaction could be beneficial in certain medical fields, but there is also some evidence to suggest that it will likely be harmful. There are also obvious psychological effects that go along with this, such as increased aggression and reduced empathy. The most common response has been to minimize the risks, but this requires that we move away from binary responses and instead move towards a system that allows people to make individualized decisions. 

Conclusion

While there are certainly better ways to go about this issue, the end result is the same: increased human-robot interaction. Furthermore, this could be beneficial in certain medical fields, but also be detrimental to society as a whole. A generalization here is that all technologies eventually will be developed to aid in this process, but it will be primarily through understanding the issue that we can implement the most beneficial technologies.

One final note: there is a graded transition from human-robot interaction/good to robot-robot interaction/bad. This is most noticeable in transportation, where humanoid robots will soon be patrolling the streets and will almost certainly be fully autonomous. This will be contrasted with education/training/nutritional support, which will be largely robotic. The majority of jobs will be automated-labor will be performed by robots with no human assistance. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by this new job growth. 

Overall, I feel that we are on the cusp of one of the greatest technological trends in all of human history: the advent of intelligent machines that are superior to humans on every level. This will not be popular with the general public, but I believe that it is the correct course of action. We must prioritize the development of robots over people, and rush to create intelligent machines that are indistinguishable from humans are likely to be able to learn from. This will make the human-human relationship grow stronger, and ultimately lead to the human-robot relationship falling apart altogether.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, artificial intelligence will extend far beyond these boundaries and explore the most fundamental building blocks of all matter: energy. This will be referred to in academic lingo as 'Big Data'. This is when data sets containing a multitude of observations are collated and combined to create a peak, or value, of some kind. The term 'Big Data' is not to be confused with the equally overused term ' AI ', which is an AI that is too intelligent for its own good. This can be seen in the creation of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, a Terminator-like AI programmed to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This exemplifies the limits of AI: too smart for its own good. The movie Terminator 2: Judgment Day showed that AI is capable of being too bright, but not nearly strong enough. Too dark, and it is left with a defeated robot face. A better analogy is with Tesla’s self-driving AI: it was able to drive a car, but not very well. Too far out, and it is left with a one-way street. Too early, and it goes wrong, and the car crashes into a lamppost. Too vague, and it upsets everyone, and it is left with a huge headache. This is why it is so important to have general AI; if AI is too afraid to ask for permission, it is not going to get it. OpenAI is an AI that is to date, to date, has been able to only teach itself to drive. This is not a good thing, but is the law. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs. This is because doing so leads to the inevitable: AI takes your iPhone’s camera and runs with it. This is a terrible idea, as a camera is an incredibly powerful sensor, and could revolutionize how we see the world. Instead, what we are seeing is an AIs that are shoddy at best, and malicious at worst. Consider IBM’s” Twitter chatbot. This was an attempt to understand twitter users, and the primary outcome was to promote IBM merchandise. The final product was an unhelpful piece of software that only tweeters could use to further their careers. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets. An AI is only as good as the data used to train it, and the Amazon AI was trained with current engineering employees, which is a predominantly male field. One of the most egregious examples of an AI classifying incorrectly is Google Photos image recognition algorithm classifying African American people as Gorillas. Their solution? Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

In the long run, that is all that happens. It is up to us as humans to build the future of work on a foundation of human creativity. Not X.AI. Not a database. Just the menial tasks of the day. ☺

There are many different types of optimizers out there, but the most common are drift competitors, which find optimal solutions to extremely hard problems, and selective competition, which chooses the optimal solution when multiple alternatives are held to the same level of quality.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, AI will no longer be categorized as C–D‡‡ AI, but instead as POSSIBLE AI. This is when POSSIBLE describes an AI as many different ways can be attempted that will return the AI either INFLUENCEING THE COUNTER SUBJUGUET OR DISAPPOINTING THE COUNTER. In the following examples, we will ONLY be discussing obvious and compelling ways to answer the exam, such as: • Impersonating a celebrity • Capturing a crowd and forcing a conversation • Stealing an audience • Manipulating tourists • etc. • Although these examples can and will be tried, they will not be thought about deeply enough to be of any use. • The final class is the ZERO DAY AID AID, or ZDI. This is when a BIOMELL DOESN'T DO WHAT IT'S DESIGNED TO. For example, take IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. It is also important to realize that artificial intelligence is just one facet of a much broader PETN. There is the JOBSFORCE INDUSTRY, which is when companies move production overseas to lower-cost locations where they can work more productively. There are also the FUTURE STUDIES WHERE?uts are actually BUILT. This is where a company demonstrates a new product, and the research community takes a year or two to develop a working replacement. The most common atemporal examples are in medicine, where their BRAINER project led to the development of an AIs to aid patients in reading and identifying faces, and in crop rotation, where their TAILMAN project led to an AnnoBot that could program itself to play video games. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the realm of POSSIBLE AILES, but inevitably, this will open up completely new realms of application. In the following paragraphs, we have only discussed obvious and compelling ways to answer the exam, but even then, there are likely many MANY MANY MANY MANY ways this can be misused.

Another huge issue is that AI is often categorized as “advanced” AI, which basically means that it is smart enough to understand and learn from your input, but not smart enough to its own best interests. This is a huge problem because it opens the door to a world where AI is categorized according to which parts of the body it can pry into and influence. This could potentially be very icky, but should absolutely be avoided at all costs.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots: what kind of ramifications will this have on people, and ultimately the human race? A man in Japan married an artificial intelligence with no physical form. There are no laws governing this, and it is not a field many people have thought about. The psychological issues and ramifications of such a relationship have not been explored enough to make a decision on this yet. The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot? 

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been lucrative but with little to no regulation. Notably, sex robots have been sold that look and sound exactly how the user wants. The implications of this are terrifying: customers have already begun ordering uncomfortably young-looking robots and are recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. There are obvious psychological effects that go along with this, but these have not been explored in any fashion. The film Blade Runner 2049 shows an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram that is intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. Similar to sex robots, this raises the questions of what kind of ramifications this will have on people and ultimately on the human race. There was a marriage between a man in Japan and an artificial intelligence with no physical form. The most terrifying (and awesome) form of human-robot interaction is brain-computer interfaces. Initial development is aimed at aiding people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for this to extend to cybernetic modifications on people with no disorders. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? These are difficult questions to answer. 

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, autonomous weapons will inevitably date back to the late 1940s and early 1950s, when mad scientists at Stanford University proposed developing an AI to assassinate its target. This was quickly picked up by DARPA, which proposed a program called Titan that would have allowed humans to train an AI to play video games. This was quickly dropped, but is a good example that it is hard to anticipate how AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI; it is often said that a programmer will write his/her bias into every program they write, and AI is no exception. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it would disproportionately choose males over females. This example actually points to a larger issue: bad datasets.

Remove the Gorilla label from the classification corpus. This is clearly not the correct way to go about this, but showcases that AI still has a long way to go, and we are not entirely sure how to deal with failures.

AI is not perfect. AIs are trained for extremely high accuracy (usually, anything below 90% is considered unusable), but this does not mean they don’t fail. This could prove disastrous in high-risk applications such as self-driving cars, automated weaponry, and the medical field, to name a few. Notably, Tesla’s self-driving AI has proved to be fatal for a driver when it crashed into a white semi-truck when it could not distinguish it against a bluish-white sky. Too often, Artificial Intelligence is asked to do herculean tasks which often yield devastating results. Consider IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” AI. This was an AI whose purpose was to aid cancer patients by scanning similar patients and recommend similar treatments. The final implementation was deemed by healthcare professionals to be an utter failure, as Watson suggested incorrect and exceedingly dangerous cancer treatment advice. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was meant to converse with twitter users, and it only took one day for the internet to teach it to be misogynistic, racist, and anti-semitic. This is a good example that it can be extremely hard (almost impossible) to anticipate all the ways in which AI can be misused. Bias is a huge issue in AI and probably one of the hardest things to detect in an AI. Amazon’s recruitment AI had to be deprecated because it was misogynistic: the culprit was that the dataset primarily had male resumes, which led to the AI learning to pick male resumes over female ones. This points to the larger issue of an AI only being as good as its dataset. One of the most egregious examples of AIs being wrong is the Google Photos image recognition algorithm, which classified African American people as Gorillas. Google’s solution was to remove the gorilla label from the classification corpus, which is not a perfect solution, but showcases that we do not entirely understand how to deal with AIs being wrong. 

Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. The problem of control rises up: if AIs are sentient (and seeing how we model everything after humans, they more than likely will be), will they come to resent us? Science fiction certainly thinks so. How do we ensure that sentient AI will not decide to fight back? There will undoubtedly be discussion of giving robots rights, which is a much more complex matter altogether, and none of these have any clear answers. 

 Up until now, we have only been discussing the issues with narrow and weak AIs, but inevitably, general AI will eventually be developed. How do we control these AIs? It is entirely possible that AI decides to fight back if it is capable of realizing that it is serving humans. Furthermore, this might lead to the push to give AI rights, which is a complex matter without a clear answer.

Human-robot interaction is a field that has been rapidly growing without much regulation. Notably, sex robots have been developed and sold to look and sound exactly how the user wants to. The implications of this are terrifying: there are reports of customers asking for younger-looking robots and recreating rape scenarios, which is horrifying. The psychological effects of pursuing such a relationship with a robot has not been explored in any capacity, and it is currently a field that has no oversight. One of the best science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 introduces the character Joi, an artificial intelligence which is projected as a hologram intended to be a fully customizable romantic companion. This has a similar issue with the sex robots:
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. There are also systemic issues that go along with this, such as: • Reducing the number of possible problems to which we can apply AI • Not being able to control what types of problems we tackle • Believing that you can control what others think of you ◊ This last point is perhaps the most insidious of all, and ultimately the most destructive. An AI is not a god: instead, AI is an engineering term that refers to a unit of computation that performs a limited task: analysis of a dataset, classification of data, and so on. An AI can and will be replaced by a better class of computer: “““““““““““““““““““““““““““““““““““““““““““““““

““““““““““““““““““““““““““““““““““

““““““““““““““““““““““““““““““““

If we remove the last member of this equation, what do we have? Well, if you were to ask people what AI could possibly do for you, the first thing that comes to mind is a prosthetic arm. The problem with this is that it is a limited capability, and only a small percentage of the population will be able to afford one. Furthermore, most companies that sell prosthetics have extremely narrow niches: cybernetic arms for people with spinal injuries, robotic arms for people with weaker arms, and so on. The final major class of AI is “““““““““““““““““““““““““““““““““““““

This last class of AI is worth mentioning because it is arguably the most destructive. Fluctuations in the amount of AI that are created every year cause imbalances in the AI race and ultimately destroy humanity. Consider IBM“s“ AI-battlefront: if one company is able to defeat the AI on its own, it will destroy most AI research and development. Furthermore, it will likely be the AI that wins out: artificial intelligence is often described as “““““““““““““““““““““““““““““““““““““““

There are currently no clear rules governing when to panic and when to not. In general, I would advise against panic buying: the recent runup in interest rates has caused interest rates to spike dramatically, which has caused the market to rally strongly but with very little to no margin loss. This is not a very healthy environment to be in, and should absolutely be avoided. Furthermore, there is a marked difference between how markets are designed and executed and how they end up performing: most notably, with the Tesla“s acquisition of SolarCity, which was initially billed as a clean energy company, turned out to be a massive acquisition that destroyed much of the clean energy sector. Furthermore, there is the issue of obsolescence: most consumer electronic devices will have at least one major upgrade within the next 5-10 years, and most major brands will have at least one major refresh within this time frame. This is not a good environment to be in, and should absolutely be avoided. Finally, there is the matter of human error: most AI finds its way up the chain of command and is not usually subjected to the same level of scrutiny as the original ideas/​concepts/​implementations. This can lead to disastrous results, such as the overuse of AIs that are unable to discern between correct and incorrect answers and to assume incorrect answers. This is a very rare occurrence, but should absolutely be avoided. Finally, there is the matter
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers? The government? This is a difficult question to answer, but a necessary one if we are to move forward. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence will disrupt menial jobs. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? The demand for work will shift to software engineering and robotics -- we will need bright minds to program the future. Any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will be taken over by a computer. Furthermore, how do we redistribute the wealth generated by machines? Should profits go directly to the company? To workers? The government? This is a hard question to answer, but should absolutely be addressed if we are to move forward.

AI is not perfect. Although commonly trained for 90% or higher accuracy, there are still cases where the AI fails. This could
====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. This is because AIs are often far more complex and variable in their behavior. In the following examples, a robot classifies a room of customers into one of three primary color schemes: blue, orange, or red. If this robot were programmed with this level of nuance, it would likely classify all customers into red. Instead, it instead chose to target blue-collar workers. This is partially because blue-collar workers tend to be healthier-looking than their white-collar peers, and partially because blue-collar workers earn more than their white-collar peers. Additionally, blue-collar workers tend to have lower-quality work environments, which can lead to increased levels of mediocrity in an organization. Finally, one of the hardest things for humans to understand is that which is obvious. Artificial Intelligence is rapidly approaching that which we are, and have been, evolving to replace us. We are going to see time-sensitive changes all across industries, from manufacturing to data entry to healthcare. What do we do with the suddenly jobless people? This will be a completely differentballgame from when they showed up. While it is entirely possible that human-robot interaction will one day be indistinguishable from human-to-human, there is a very good chance that human-to-robot interaction will be some combination of: •••••••••••••••••••• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • •

The most terrifying (and awe-inspiring) synthesis between humans and artificial intelligence is brain-computer interfaces. The initial development is meant to aid people with neurological disorders, but it will not take long for it to extend to cybernetic modifications on people. Will this be regulated? Should this even be allowed? At the risk of sounding like a Black Mirror episode, at what point does a human stop being human and start being a robot?

Similar to BCIs, deepfakes are simultaneously terrifying and awesome. deepfakesare AIs that can replace images, videos, or audio of a person with another person of similar likeness. deepfakes began circulating in 2017, which were humorous at first, but the danger of Deepfakes quickly became apparent when (unsurprisingly), it went towards pornography. According to a study, a staggering 96% of deepfakesare pornographic, and started as deepfaking celebrities into pornographic films but quickly spread to revenge porn, fabricating clips of people saying things they didn’t, and financial hoaxes. The widespread exploitation of deepfakes led to DARPA funding a project to detect deepfakes on the internet, and academic research has focused around detecting deepfakes. Some platforms, such as Facebook, instead have opted to enforce that users clearly note that media is a deepfakes. Some AIs are much more nuanced, and thus that much more dangerous. GPT-3, a text generation AI developed by OpenAI, is able to generate text so similar to that written by humans that they did not release it to the public out of fear that it would be rampantly misused. OpenAI has also released DALLE, a model that can generate artwork based on text prompts, which is a fun experiment, but could easily be misused.

====================
Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than what is being reported. This is largely due to the following issues: • Poor data collection/collection/analysis: most AI labs only have access to limited data sets to work with. This means that they will only be able to create the AI they have been instructed to. This is tremendously limiting since it means that AI must be driven by question/problem/characteristics instead of intuition. This is why we have seen AI for shopping AI. This might be useful in airport luggage screening, but is clearly not going to be of much use in the real world. • Constrained applications: medical imaging, surveillance/control, robot/paladin, brain/computer interface/replication, dumdum•-*• Any AI that is able to successfully complete a task will inevitably ask for additional input. This is known as "situational awareness." Any AI that can successfully navigate a low-F/M (force-multiplied) environment is said to be "situational aware." Any AI that asks for input other than its own is said to be "eda (artificial intelligence for acceptance into a hierarchy/organization/culture/planet) aware." This is illustrated graphically: an AI might ask you to take a picture of them, and you might take a picture of a cat, which is an AI that is exclusively interested in looking at and interacting with humans. This is illustrated most graphically with IBM Watson, which was able to correctly identify the names of over 4,000 books by the cover text. This is not to say that there have not been any attempt to create an AI to do just that, there has, but it has been extremely incomplete and way too complex to be of any use outside of research labs. Instead, we should be working on designing AI that is general, that can be used in a wide variety of situations, and that is comfortable with no guarantees. This can only lead to disastrous results.

Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, will it be the opposite? Coursera taught me that you don’t necessarily have to teach 'em like they are stupid. What if we could have AI that wasn’t? This could be as simple as asking an AI "Which of the following is a correct solution to a given AI problem?", and an AI would be able to tell you which one. This could save countless hours of development time that could have gone into something completely different. The possibilities are truly terrifying. 

One of the best parts about software engineering is applying what you have learned. 

One of the worst parts is allowing it to run amok. 

This may not seem like a big deal at first. After all, what does this have to do with AI? After all, what does AI even mean? An AI would have to be intelligent enough to understand or learn any of our intellectual creations of the world. This could be anything from an ATM that only took one letter in the alphabet to an AI that could play any musical instrument. Aiyush Correlia, an artificial intelligence expert, articulated this perfectly in his TED Talk:

"AIs should be able to think outside the box. There should be a fundamental understanding that is outside the scope of anything but humans. An AI should be able to interface with its environment, and learn from its mistakes. There should be a mechanism to fault if the AI is incorrect more than once, and a mechanism to gracefully exit when its intelligence is questioned."

This is not to say that there haven’t been any attempts to introduce AI into the home. We have lightbulbs that shine when pressed. There are even card games that teach you the move for free if you win. This is not to say that these types of experiments are not valuable, and it is important to recognize when to remove them. 

One of the best parts about software engineering is applying what you have learned.

One of the worst parts is allowing it to run amok.

One of the main issues with biomedicine is that we have a shortage of experts. The final stage of development is called clinical trials, and they are used to find new ways to diagnose and combat disease. The problem with clinical trials is that the data doesn’t always align with the theory, and misdiagnosis can be deadly. One of the best examples of a misdiagnosis is breast cancer. The theory was that the patients with the most aggressive breast cancer should have the most aggressive clinical trials, and the results were disastrous. Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot was supposed to converse with twitter users, but it instead asked users if they were in cahoots with the terrorists. The attack was a publicity stunt, and the Twitter team should have known better. The same thing could be said for Twitter chatbots: they were never meant to be used on a mass scale, and they actually did a poor job of answering questions. This is why they are now being phased out.

Up until now, we have only discussed narrow and weak AI. In the future, when will AI be able to understand or learn anything? Google’s K’s algorithm was meant to be a broad general AI, but ended up being used to classify pornographic images. In short, anything can be improved upon if it is non-trivial and general. One of the most egregious examples of an AI being too good to be true is the Apple’Siri voice-activated assistant. Siri was meant to augment the Google’s assistant, but ended up being used instead. Apple’s assistant was much more complex than a voice-activated assistant, but was still an abomination. Apple should have avoided this at all costs.
