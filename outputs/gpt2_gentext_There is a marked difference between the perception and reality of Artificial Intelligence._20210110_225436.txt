There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction films and novels have portrayed AI as sentient autonomous machines that threaten humanity’s very existence. This generalized AI does not exist yet; today’s AI is an application of advanced mathematics to solve very specific problems. Academic literature refers to this as “narrow” AI, because the AI is unable to do anything other than the problem it has been tuned for. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to create an AI to mimic elements of the mind; this field of AI is referred to as “weak” AI, and is most familiar to you as the voice assistants of today: Cortana, Google Assistant, and Siri. This is also why they perform abysmally; ask them anything outside of their limited scope of knowledge and the response will be unhelpful. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers?

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers?
====================
There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction films and novels have portrayed AI as sentient autonomous machines that threaten humanity’s very existence. This generalized AI does not exist yet; today’s AI is an application of advanced mathematics to solve very specific problems. Academic literature refers to this as “narrow” AI, because the AI is unable to do anything other than the problem it has been tuned for. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to create an AI to mimic elements of the mind; this field of AI is referred to as “weak” AI, and is most familiar to you as the voice assistants of today: Cortana, Google Assistant, and Siri. This is also why they perform abysmally; ask them anything outside of their limited scope of knowledge and the response will be unhelpful. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses.

Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers?
====================
There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction films and novels have portrayed AI as sentient autonomous machines that threaten humanity’s very existence. This generalized AI does not exist yet; today’s AI is an application of advanced mathematics to solve very specific problems. Academic literature refers to this as “narrow” AI, because the AI is unable to do anything other than the problem it has been tuned for. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to create an AI to mimic elements of the mind; this field of AI is referred to as “weak” AI, and is most familiar to you as the voice assistants of today: Cortana, Google Assistant, and Siri. This is also why they perform abysmally; ask them anything outside of their limited scope of knowledge and the response will be unhelpful. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks.

The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers?

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction films and novels have portrayed AI as sentient autonomous machines that threaten humanity’s very existence. This generalized AI does not exist yet; today’s AI is an application of advanced mathematics to solve very specific problems. Academic literature refers to this as “narrow” AI, because the AI is unable to do anything other than the problem it has been tuned for. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to create an AI to mimic elements of the mind; this field of AI is referred to as “weak” AI, and is most familiar to you as the voice assistants of today: Cortana, Google Assistant, and Siri. This is also why they perform abysmally; ask them anything outside of their limited scope of knowledge and the response will be unhelpful.

This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to create an AI to mimic elements of the mind; this field of AI is referred to as “weak” AI, and is most familiar to you as the voice assistants of today: Cortana, Google Assistant, and Siri. This is also why they perform abysmally; ask them anything outside of their limited scope of knowledge and the response will be unhelpful. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers?

This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers?
====================
There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction films and novels have portrayed AI as sentient autonomous machines that threaten humanity’s very existence. This generalized AI does not exist yet; today’s AI is an application of advanced mathematics to solve very specific problems. Academic literature refers to this as “narrow” AI, because the AI is unable to do anything other than the problem it has been tuned for. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to create an AI to mimic elements of the mind; this field of AI is referred to as “weak” AI, and is most familiar to you as the voice assistants of today: Cortana, Google Assistant, and Siri. This is also why they perform abysmally; ask them anything outside of their limited scope of knowledge and the response will be unhelpful. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.

The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers?
====================
There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction films and novels have portrayed AI as sentient autonomous machines that threaten humanity’s very existence. This generalized AI does not exist yet; today’s AI is an application of advanced mathematics to solve very specific problems. Academic literature refers to this as “narrow” AI, because the AI is unable to do anything other than the problem it has been tuned for. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to create an AI to mimic elements of the mind; this field of AI is referred to as “weak” AI, and is most familiar to you as the voice assistants of today: Cortana, Google Assistant, and Siri. This is also why they perform abysmally; ask them anything outside of their limited scope of knowledge and the response will be unhelpful. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for.

It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers?

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction films and novels have portrayed AI as sentient autonomous machines that threaten humanity’s very existence. This generalized AI does not exist yet; today’s AI is an application of advanced mathematics to solve very specific problems. Academic literature refers to this as “narrow” AI, because the AI is unable to do anything other than the problem it has been tuned for. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to create an AI to mimic elements of the mind; this field of AI is referred to as “weak” AI, and is most familiar to you as the voice assistants of today: Cortana, Google Assistant, and Siri. This is also why they perform abysmally; ask them anything outside of their limited scope of knowledge and the response will be unhelpful. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence.

Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess.

It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers?

====================
There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction films and novels have portrayed AI as sentient autonomous machines that threaten humanity’s very existence. This generalized AI does not exist yet; today’s AI is an application of advanced mathematics to solve very specific problems. Academic literature refers to this as “narrow” AI, because the AI is unable to do anything other than the problem it has been tuned for. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to create an AI to mimic elements of the mind; this field of AI is referred to as “weak” AI, and is most familiar to you as the voice assistants of today: Cortana, Google Assistant, and Siri. This is also why they perform abysmally; ask them anything outside of their limited scope of knowledge and the response will be unhelpful. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry.

It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers?
====================
There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction films and novels have portrayed AI as sentient autonomous machines that threaten humanity’s very existence. This generalized AI does not exist yet; today’s AI is an application of advanced mathematics to solve very specific problems. Academic literature refers to this as “narrow” AI, because the AI is unable to do anything other than the problem it has been tuned for. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to create an AI to mimic elements of the mind; this field of AI is referred to as “weak” AI, and is most familiar to you as the voice assistants of today: Cortana, Google Assistant, and Siri. This is also why they perform abysmally; ask them anything outside of their limited scope of knowledge and the response will be unhelpful. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers?

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction films and novels have portrayed AI as sentient autonomous machines that threaten humanity’s very existence. This generalized AI does not exist yet; today’s AI is an application of advanced mathematics to solve very specific problems. Academic literature refers to this as “narrow” AI, because the AI is unable to do anything other than the problem it has been tuned for. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to create an AI to mimic elements of the mind; this field of AI is referred to as “weak” AI, and is most familiar to you as the voice assistants of today: Cortana, Google Assistant, and Siri. This is also why they perform abysmally; ask them anything outside of their limited scope of knowledge and the response will be unhelpful. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the capabilities and expectations of Artificial Intelligence.

This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess.

Science fiction writers, film directors, and artists would have you believe that AI is manifested in sentient robots that are binary equivalents of humans. This kind of AI is referred to in academic literature as “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Generalized AI is not here yet -- instead, what you will find are “narrow” AIs that are trained to accomplish very specific tasks: identify an image, suggest an enjoyable movie, predict the next word in a sentence, etc. Narrow AI has been able to dethrone the world champion at Go, vanquish the Jeopardy champions, and defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. There are also “weak” AIs that can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant: these voice assistants have a very narrow spectrum they can operate in, and asking any question outside of their limited scope will result in unhelpful responses. It is important to realize that artificial intelligence is on the rise - just slower than the media coverage would lead you to believe.

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Media is hyperfocused on “strong” AI, which is an AI that is intelligent enough to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This is the kind of AI glamorized in films and novels. In reality, AI today is much more boring. The majority of AI in production today is “narrow” AI, which are trained and fine tuned to perform extremely specific tasks. You may have heard of Google’s DeepMind AI, which dethroned the world champion at Go. IBM Watson dominated against the Jeopardy champions. These AIs are all narrow; they can only play the game they have been trained for. Furthermore, most AI found today is not nearly as exciting: data analysis, image classification, and signal processing. These applications do not attract media attention, but are incredibly important to their respective fields. The final major class of AI is “weak” AIs, which can implement a limited part of a mind, but not the entire mind. The most common examples include Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. These AIs have a very limited scope of operation, and asking any question outside of this scope will result in largely unhelpful responses.

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a plethora of ethical and practical concerns that have arisen. In the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore a few of these concerns.   

Even though we don’t have general AI, there have already been a myriad of concerns that have arisen. We will now briefly explore these concerns. 

Even without general AI, narrow and weak AI have brought several ethical and practical concerns up that should absolutely be dealt with. 

One of the primary issues is that artificial intelligence replaces menial labor. What do we do with the people who have suddenly become jobless? This will no doubt shift the job demand towards fields such as software engineering and robotics, but there will be notable disruptions in areas such as manufacturing and data entry. In short, any task that is simple enough to be learned by a computer will more than likely be taken over by a computer. This is widely viewed as a good thing, as it allows humans to focus on more creative and difficult problems to solve. However, there is the unanswered issue of how to redistribute the wealth generated by machines. Companies such as Alibaba and Amazon now have warehouses entirely staffed by robots. Should the money made by these warehouses go to the company? The workers?

There is a marked difference between the perception and reality of Artificial Intelligence. Science fiction films and novels have portrayed AI as sentient autonomous machines that threaten humanity’s very existence. This generalized AI does not exist yet; today’s AI is an application of advanced mathematics to solve very specific problems. Academic literature refers to this as “narrow” AI, because the AI is unable to do anything other than the problem it has been tuned for. This is not to say that there have not been any attempts to create an AI to mimic elements of the mind; this field of AI is referred to as “weak” AI, and is most familiar to you as the voice assistants of today: Cortana, Google Assistant, and Siri. This is also why they perform abysmally; ask them anything outside of their limited scope of knowledge and the response will be unhelpful.
